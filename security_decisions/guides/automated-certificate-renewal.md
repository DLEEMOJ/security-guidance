# Automated certificate renewal

Where technically suitable, all new MOJ domains **must** use automated certificate techniques and services, such as [AWS Certificate Manager](https://aws.amazon.com/certificate-manager/) (most preferred) or [LetsEncrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/) (uses [ACME](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automated_Certificate_Management_Environment))

Over time, existing MOJ domains **must** also be considered for migration to automated certificate provisioning and management techniques (preferably on their next certificate renewal cycle in advance of expiry) in order to reduce the consequences and management overheads of manual certificate renewal.

The MOJ acknowledges that not all systems support automated certificate management but leveraging such technology where possible reduces management overheads, the costs of such overheads and the consequences of unexpected certificate expiry.
