# Web Check

## The service

The [Web Check Service](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/blog-post/web-check-helping-you-secure-your-public-sector-websites) from NCSC is part of the [Active Cyber Defence](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/blog-post/active-cyber-defence-tackling-cyber-attacks-uk) suite of services.

The service scans provided URLs for a series of indicators (negative and positive technical security configurations) and reports them through a web interface, email alerts and exportable report file.

Domains operated by, or on behalf of, MOJ **must** be added to Web Check under at least the central MOJ Web Check account.

## How to use the service

### Requirements

The fully-qualified domain name or URL is required. It must be publicly accessible from the general Internet  and present as a website on HTTP (TCP/80) and/or HTTPS (TCP/443).

MOJ is permitted to use the service for free as a central government organisation, but suppliers to MOJ currently are not.

### Get started

Contact the MOJ Cybersecurity team to be added into MOJ's subscription of the service.
