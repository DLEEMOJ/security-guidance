# Criminal Justice Secure Mail

The MOJ operates the CJSM service to enable those people working in the Justice system who do not have access to a suitable email service to exchange information in a safer way.

The MOJ does **not** require the use of CJSM where other suitably secure and efficient means can be used. It is considered a safe option to enable communication but it is only an option.

## Government secure email policy

Email services that are materially aligned to the [UK government secure email policy](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/securing-government-email) are suitable for the movement of `OFFICIAL` data, including where the `SENSITIVE` handling caveat has been applied.
