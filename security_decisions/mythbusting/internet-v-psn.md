# Internet -v- PSN

## The internet is 'ok'

The MOJ prefers the use of public commodity networks (such as the Internet) over the use of dedicated or private network links.

### Networks are bearers

The MOJ consider networks, whether private or public, to be bearers for information transfer, in and of themselves they should not be considered as the mechanism to identify and confer trust or privilege.
