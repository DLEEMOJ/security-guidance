# Assessing suppliers

The MOJ assesses suppliers as a responsible public body managing public funds and data. These assessments range from commercial and legal for the purposes of contract through to risk assessments for the purposes of information security.

The MOJ utilises a range of [risk management](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/guidance/risk-management-collection) techniques including [information risk assessments](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/guidance/summary-risk-methods-and-frameworks).

Suppliers are expected to create, maintain and demonstrate a mature and considered approach to risk management when engaged with the MOJ.

## Accreditation

The MOJ no longer accredits new systems or suppliers (as defined by CESG Information Assurance Standard 1&2).

The MOJ maintains accreditations where committed to by existing contract.

## Commodity digital technology

MOJ assesses commodity digital technology supply chain such as Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) tools such as Google G-Suite, Microsoft Office 365, Trello and AtlassianCloud based on the [Cloud Security Principles](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/guidance/implementing-cloud-security-principles), information risk assessment techniques and shared data within HMG.
