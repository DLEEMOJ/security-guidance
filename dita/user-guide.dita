    <title>How the Consultancy team handle requests for help</title>
    <body>
      <p>Each working day, we review all new requests.</p>
      <p>Our Service Level Agreement aims to get a reply to you within two working days of us receiving the request. Some large or complex requests might need more information and discussion. These requests take extra time for us to work out the best way to support you.</p>
      <p>Some requests might not be appropriate for the team. In such cases, we send a prompt reply, explaining why it would be better to talk with a different team. We'll usually recommend a more appropriate team, and provide contact details for them.</p>
