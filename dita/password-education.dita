      <p>What a strange title for an article. These words are all in the top 20 most common passwords used in the UK in 2020. The number 1 most common password, both globally and in the UK, is <codeph>123456</codeph>. The passwords in the title are the 3rd most common UK password (<codeph>liverpool</codeph>), the 15th (<codeph>monkey</codeph>), and the 18th (<codeph>chocolate</codeph>).</p>
      <p>The list they appear on comes out every year and is based on research by independent cybersecurity incident researchers. These are all passwords that were exposed in 2020. They are ranked based on how many times they appear. There are lots of lists like this on the internet, with lots of common passwords on. Hackers use them to add to their password dictionaries.</p>
      <image href="images/nordpass2020.png" placement="break" scope="local"><alt>Screenshot from the Nordpass password list 2020. This is a list of the findings for the UK. It lists the top 9 ranked passwords used, the time taken to crack them, and the count for each password. The number 1 password is 123456; it takes less than 1 second to crack. Number 2 is password; it takes less than 1 second to crack. Number 3 is liverpool; it takes less than 1 second to crack. Number 4 is password1; it takes less than 1 second to crack. Number 5 is 123456789; it takes less than 1 second to crack. Number 6 is 12345; it takes less than 1 second to crack. Number 7 is qwerty; it takes less than 1 second to crack. Number 8 is liverpool1; it takes less than 1 second to crack. Lastly, number 9 is charlie; it takes less than 1 second to crack.</alt></image>

      <p>These dictionaries are used to guess people's passwords. This is called password cracking. The dictionary lists often have hundreds of thousands of words and passwords in. They include common formulas that people use to create passwords; things like <codeph>Spring2022!</codeph> that changes to <codeph>Summer2022!</codeph> then <codeph>Autumn2022!</codeph>, or the name of something at work with a number at the end that is changed every so often, like <codeph>Justice123</codeph>. Formulaic passwords like this are very easy to guess.</p>
      <p>Hackers also use rules to help them guess common password formulas. These allow for multiple versions of each guess to try commonly used password making techniques. They include substitutions for letters and adding numbers and symbols to the end.</p>
      <image href="images/hacker-password-rules.png" placement="break" scope="local"><alt>Image showing different rules that can be used. The first rule is 'add a number at the end', then there is an image of a key, then a box with 'monkey1, monkey2, monkey3, ..., monkey9' in one column and 'monkey001, monkey002, monkey003, ..., monkey999' in the second column. The next rule is 'add a special character at the end', then there is an image of a key, then there is a box with 'monkey!, chocolate!, liverpool! in one column and 'monkey$, monkey&amp;, monkey% in the second column. The final rule is 'substitute a letter for a number or special character', then there is an image of a key, then a box with 'monkey, m0nkey, monk3y, m0nk3y' in one column and 'password, p4$$word, p@55w0rd, p@$5w0rd' in the second column.</alt></image>
      <p>Examples of rules used by hackers in a dictionary list.</p>
      <p>But it must take ages to run through hundreds of thousands of words to crack your password, surely? Not at all. Remember those three passwords in the title of this article? They take less than 1 second to crack. Computers can make billions of guesses every second. The more common a password is, the easier it is to crack. The shorter a password is, the easier it is to crack.</p>

      <p>For each character in a password there are 94 possible choices:</p>
      <p>26 upper case letters + 26 lower case letters + 32 special characters + 10 numbers = 94 possible characters</p>
      <p>Computers are so powerful now that they can crack a short password almost instantly. Every additional character used increases the potential combinations exponentially.</p>
      <p>To work out how many combinations are possible for your password you multiply 94 to the power of how many characters are in your password.</p>

combinations of characters in a password

Compare the 8 character password possible combinations to the 20
character password possible combinations. It could take a computer under
an hour to crack an 8 character password ([this TechRepublic article
shows how fast computers can crack
passwords)](https://www.techrepublic.com/article/how-an-8-character-password-could-be-cracked-in-less-than-an-hour/#:~:text=Must%2Dread%20security%20coverage&text=As%20described%20in%20a%20recent,the%20latest%20graphics%20processing%20technology.).
However, it would take an unreasonably long time to crack a 20 character
password. That would take billions of years.

## What Makes a Bad Password?

Bad passwords are short, use an easy to guess formula like changing a
season or a month or adding a number to the end, they use special
characters like \! at the end, they use a common word or combination of
numbers that lots of other people use like 123456. There are popular
formulas and patterns as well:

  - 1q2w3e4r is the 47th most common password globally

  - qwertyuiop is the 25th most common password globally

  - 789456123 is the 100th most common password globally

These can all be cracked in under 1 second.

Complex random passwords are very hard for people to remember. A short
password, no matter how complex, is easy to crack. Remember,
**complexity is not strength**.

## So, how can you make a good password?

When it comes to passwords **Length is Strength**.

Use three or four random words to create a passphrase that is easy to
remember and very strong.

Flip through a dictionary or use an online random word generator to
collect a few random words. Put them together in a way that you will be
able to remember - maybe it makes you laugh. Once you have a long
password you can make it complex by adding numbers and special
characters between the words. Some examples of putting three or four
random words together to make very strong and hard to crack passwords
are:

  - NervousTrouser8Snake

  - GreenDuck9Burgerrooftop

  - fortunegreenhouseelephantsunflower

  - custard\!porridge4RailwayChicken

## Things to avoid when making a password

It is really important when picking your random words that they aren't
connected to you, your family, your pets, or your workplace. Don't use
names of friends or important dates like birthdays or weddings. Hackers
can look at data online about you and your connections to discover
things like your favourite food or musician, your pet's name or breed,
and other things it is tempting to use in a password. Avoid using lyrics
and quotes as those will also be in that big dictionary list used for
cracking passwords. Always use a unique password for every account you
have.

[Multi-factor authentication
(MFA)](https://security-guidance.service.justice.gov.uk/phishing-guide/#multi-factor-authentication-mfa),
also called two factor authentication (2FA), is a great way to add extra
security to your accounts. This requires you to enter a code after
entering your password. No-one will ever ask you for this code. You
should be the only one entering the MFA code. You should only enter the
MFA code if you are actively logging in to your account yourself. If a
hacker does manage to crack your password, they won't have your MFA code
so they won't be able to access your account.

Password managers are a great way to store all your passwords safely.
They remember your passwords for you. Make sure you have a strong
password to login to the password manager (remember, **length is
strength\!**). Password managers can also suggest long strong passwords
for you. You can write passwords down in a password book, but make sure
you store this away from your computer. If you travel with your laptop,
never keep your password book in the same bag in case your laptop bag
gets stolen. This way the thief won't also have your passwords. If you
use one in an office keep it locked away when not in use. Never create a
digital file with your passwords in.

## Recap\!

Short passwords are easy for hackers to guess. Short passwords no matter
how complex are easy to crack. Complexity is not strength. Use 3 or 4
random words to create a long strong password. Remember, **Length is
Strength**. You can add complexity once you have a long password by
putting numbers or special characters between your random words. We have
a [very short micro survey](https://forms.office.com/r/tWAF61rW3a) where
you get to rate the strength of passwords. It takes less than two
minutes\!
