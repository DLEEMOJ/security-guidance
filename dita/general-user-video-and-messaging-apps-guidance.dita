			<p>When working from home, you still need to communicate with <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/mojlong"/> colleagues.
			You'll also need to work with people outside the <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/moj"/>.
			There are various tools you might use, besides the standard email and telephone tools.
			This document tells you about the tools you can, and cannot, use for business purposes.
			This guidance applies to all staff and contractors who work for the <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/moj"/>.</p>
			<p>Some ALBs, Agencies, or other large groups within the <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/moj"/> might have their own,

			<ul>
				<li>A corporate account is for making official <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/moj"/> statements and providing official views.
				Only a small number of authorised people can use it.</li>
				<li>A work account is your normal <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/moj"/> account, that you use every day for business as usual.
				Only you have access to your work account.</li>
				<li>A personal account is your own personal account on gmail, hotmail, yahoo, and so on.
					You should never use a personal account for business purposes.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Some of the applications listed make a distinction between general use with a work account, and use with a corporate account.
				Using a tool with a corporate account means you are providing views or statements on behalf of the <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/moj"/>.
				Never use a personal account for business purposes with any tool.</p>
			<p>Remember that if you are authorised to use a corporate account,
				you are speaking and acting for the whole of the <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/moj"/>.
				When working with a personal account,
				you are speaking and acting as an <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/moj"/> employee and a civil servant.</p>

			<p>The NCSC has excellent guidance on <xref href="https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/guidance/video-conferencing-services-using-them-securely" format="html" scope="external">using video conferencing services safely</xref>.</p>
			<p>Key things to remember <i>before</i> a call include:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Make sure your video conferencing account (or the device or app you are using for video conferencing) is protected with a strong password.</li>
				<li>Test the service before making (or joining) your first call.</li>
				<li>Understand what features are available, for example recording the call or sharing files or screen information.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Key things to remember for <i>every</i> call include:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Do not make the calls public, for example always require a password to join the call.</li>
				<li>Know who is joining the call, in particular check that everyone is known and expected to be present,
					and that people who have dialled in have identified themselves clearly and sufficiently.</li>
				<li>Consider your surroundings,
					for example checking what can be seen behind you (forgetting to check information on a whiteboard or noticeboard is an easy mistake).</li>

				<p><codeph>OFFICIAL-SENSITIVE</codeph> is not a classification.
				<codeph>SENSITIVE</codeph> is a handling caveat for a small subset of information marked <codeph>OFFICIAL</codeph> that requires special handling by staff.

				<p>Some communications tools expect to have a copy of your contacts list.

				<p>Data protection legislation makes you responsible for personal information you work with.
					You must keep it safe and secure.
					In particular, you must follow data protection obligations.

				<p>Many of the tools are only used for your day-to-day communication with colleagues.
					The information you work with is typically <xref href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/government-security-classifications" format="html" scope="external">classified</xref> at <codeph>OFFICIAL</codeph>.</p>
				<p>Think about the <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/moj"/> information you work with when using these tools.
				What would happen if you lost your mobile device, or it's stolen?
				Suppose the voice or video call was overheard in a cafe, or read from your screen on a crowded train.
				Could there be damaging consequences?
				If the answer is 'No', then it's probably OK to use the tool to communicate that information with colleagues.</p>
				<p>You have a duty of confidentiality and a responsibility to safeguard any HMG information or data that you access.
					This is <xref href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/government-security-classifications" format="html" scope="external">Principle 2</xref> of the Government Security Classifications.
					The <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/moj"/> trusts you to work with <codeph>OFFICIAL</codeph> information.
					You're trusted to make a reasoned judgement about whether it's safe to use an approved tool,
					or whether you should use a different <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/moj"/>-provided work tool.</p>
				<p>Remember that it is impossible to delete information after it's released in public.</p>

			<title>Storage and data retention</title>
			<body>
				<p>Laws and regulations make the <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/moj"/> and its employees responsible for managing information. Some examples include:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Freedom of Information Act.</li>
					<li>Data Protection Act and General Data Protection Regulation.</li>
					<li>Public Records Acts.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>When we receive a request for information,
					we need to know where we hold all the relevant information.
					Storing business information on appropriate <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/moj"/> systems helps us, because:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>We can provide evidence about decisions.</li>
					<li>We understand the information held, and where to find it.</li>
					<li>We can transfer records to The National Archives.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>Always store <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/moj"/> information in <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/moj"/> systems.
				If you use a tool for work tasks,
				make sure the key information is stored in an appropriate <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/moj"/> system.
				Guidance on what you must keep is available on the Intranet <xref href="https://intranet.justice.gov.uk/guidance/knowledge-information/managing-information/what-to-keep/" format="html" scope="external">here</xref>.
				At regular and convenient intervals,
				transfer the information to an appropriate <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/moj"/> system.
				Do the same when you finish the work.
				Don't forget to remove any redundant information from a tool by clearing or deleting data if it has been preserved in an <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/moj"/> system.</p>
				<p>Many tools lets you export your data.
					You can then store it on an appropriate <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/moj"/> system.
					Sometimes it's easier to copy and paste text into a new document.
					Make sure that only the correct people have access to the information.
					This is important after staff or organisational changes, for example.</p>
				<p>For more guidance, read the <xref href="https://intranet.justice.gov.uk/documents/2015/04/information-management-policy.pdf" format="pdf" scope="external"><ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/moj"/> Information Management Policy</xref> on the Intranet.

		<title>Acceptable Use</title>
		<body>
			<p>You must use communications tools for business purposes in an acceptable way.</p>
			<p>Be sensible when using communications tools for <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/moj"/> business purposes:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Be extra careful with sensitive and personal information in tools.</li>
				<li>Try to avoid using the same tool for business and personal use - you can get confused who you're talking with.</li>
				<li>If the message you're about to send might cause problems, upset, offence, or embarrassment, it's not acceptable.</li>
				<li>Context is important - a message you might think is funny could be upsetting to someone else.</li>
				<li>If something goes wrong, report it.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>The bottom line is: <i>"if there is doubt, there is no doubt - ask for help!".</i></p>

		<title>NHS Track and Trace</title>
		<body>
			<p>The official <xref href="https://www.nhs.uk/apps-library/nhs-covid-19/" format="html" scope="external">NHS Covid-19</xref> app was designed by the NHS.
			Both NCSC and Cabinet Office have been involved in the security of the system.
			The app provides contact tracing, local area alerts and venue check-in.
			It enables you to protect yourself and your loved ones.
			Installation is optional, but recommended.</p>
			<p>After installing the app, you'll receive an alert if you have been in close contact with other people who have tested positive for coronavirus.
			You can then take action to avoid passing the virus on, for example by self-isolating.</p>
			<p>From a security perspective,
				it is safe for you to use the app on your personal or <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/moj"/> issued devices.
				There are no extra risks for colleagues with security clearance, such as SC and DV.</p>
			<p>If you wish to install the app, start at the <xref href="https://covid19.nhs.uk/" format="html" scope="external">NHS site</xref>.</p>
			<p><b>Note:</b> The NHS app may not work on some older <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/moj"/> devices.
			Installation might not be possible, for example on Quantum smartphones.</p>
			<p>You might have both a personal and an <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/moj"/> issued device.
				Think about which device makes most sense to use with the app.
				It's best to install on the device that you carry with you and use most of the time.
			You could install on all your devices if you prefer.</p>
			<p>To reduce the likelihood of false alerts on the app, turn off the app's Bluetooth mode.
				Do this when:
				<ul>
					<li>You are working in environments with protective Covid measures in-place,
						for example plexiglass separators.</li>
						<li>You need to leave your personal or work device in a locker, for example  during a sports activity or to work in a secure <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/moj"/> facility.</li>
