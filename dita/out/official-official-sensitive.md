## OFFICIAL

`OFFICIAL` is a UK HM Government information asset classification under the [Government Security Classifications Policy \(GSCP\)](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/government-security-classifications).

## OFFICIAL-SENSITIVE

`OFFICIAL-SENSITIVE` is **not** a classification. `SENSITIVE` is a handling caveat for a small subset of information marked OFFICIAL that require *special* handling by staff above and beyond the decribed `OFFICIAL` baseline.

The `SENSITIVE` handling caveat is a *reminder* as opposed to a requirement for additional controls nor a description of a minimum set of controls.

### DESCRIPTORS

Descriptors *can* be applied \(but they do not need to be\) to help identify certain categories of `SENSITIVE` information.

Descriptors should be applied in the format `OFFICIAL-SENSITIVE [DESCRIPTOR]`

The Cabinet Office maintains the following list of core descriptors to ensure a consistent approach is adopted across all departments:

-   `COMMERCIAL`: Commercial- or market-sensitive information, including that subject to statutory or regulatory obligations, that may be damaging to HMG or to a commercial partner if improperly accessed.

-   `LOCSEN`: Sensitive information that locally engaged staff overseas cannot access.

-   `PERSONAL`: Particularly sensitive information relating to an identifiable individual, where inappropriate access could have damaging consequences. For example, where relating to investigations, vulnerable individuals, or the personal / medical records of people in sensitive posts \(e.g. military, SIA\).


Descriptors are **not** codewords.
