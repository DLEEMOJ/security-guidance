# Vulnerability scanning

## The base principle

All systems and applications **must** be scanned using commodity tooling for known vulnerabilities such as, but not limited to, [OWASP Top 10](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Top_Ten_Cheat_Sheet) application issues.

Any issues found must be proportionally considered for remediation prior to progression into production.

## Application vulnerabilities

Applications **must** be scanned programmatically during development and build pipelines \(prior to the final release to production\) for vulnerabilities.

Tools such as [OWASP ZAP](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Zed_Attack_Proxy_Project) may be useful.
