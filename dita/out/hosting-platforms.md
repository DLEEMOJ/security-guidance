# Hosting Platforms

We have developed a series of logging requirements for hosting platforms, such as virtualised and/or containered compute with associated supporting services such as database and queuing services at different maturity tiers in order to support defenisve cyber security, such as detecting breaches.

## Baseline Maturity Tier

### 1. User directory services

Log Collection Principle\(s\): 1, 2

User directory services must create and forward Authentication and Authorisation events from the directory service itself.

User directories within hosting environments can be rich and diverse, such technologies include:

-   Active Directory \(AD\)

-   Azure Active Directory

-   OpenLDAP

-   Amazon Web Services \(Accounts and Incognito\)

-   Okta

-   Auth0

-   Github.com \(acting as an identity provider\)

-   Google G-Suite \(acting as an identity provider\)

-   Local user stores within operating systems


These event types must be logged and forward:

-   a: account creation

-   b: account lockout

-   c: account reinstatement

-   d: account authentication failures

-   e: account authentication successes after 1 or more failures

-   f: account password changes

-   g: group membership addition / deletion \(in particular, any group that gives admin access\)

-   h: group creation

-   i: privilege modification for users \(for example, role delegation through AWS IAM\)

-   k: multi-factor authentication state, such as:

    -   1: enabled

    -   2: disabled

    -   3: reset/rotation

    -   4: recovery method used


### 2. Bastion/Jump/Action-proxy services

Log Collection Principle\(s\): 1, 2, 6

Bastion/jump boxes that act as a management consolidation route and should be highly auditable therefore must create and forward security-related event data.

-   a: SSH keypair generation/revocation, including:

    -   1: public key

    -   2: keypair ‘friendly name’ / identifier

-   b: account login attempts

    -   1: public key

    -   2: username


### 3. Domain name service query logs

Log Collection Principle\(s\): 4

DNS query logs must be created and forwarded.

-   a: client IP address

-   b: query

-   c: query response content including

    -   1: returned record\(s\) or NXDOMAIN

    -   2: authoritative nameserver

-   d: query response code

-   e: zone and/or view identifier \(if local zone response and/or multiview\)


This remains true for where nodes \(for example, servers\) may bypass internal DNS services.

### 4. Web proxy access logs

Log Collection Principle\(s\): 5

Where web traffic proxies exist, access logs should be created and forward and must, include the following variables.

-   a: authenticated user name \(if applicable\)

-   b: client identifiers:

    -   1: IP address

    -   2: reverse lookup client name \(if applicable\)

-   c: HTTP method \(for example, CONNECT GET\)

-   d: Where available, full destination/target URL or SNI value

-   e: connection return status code \(for example, 200 or 403\)

-   f: size of response


### 5. Hypervisor events

Log Collection Principle\(s\): 3, 6

Hypervisors manage virtualised compute resources and are entrusted to segregate the same. All instructions to hypervisors should be highly auditable.

-   a: virtual machine creation \(including templates\)

    -   1: identifier\(s\)

    -   2: operating system image information

-   b: virtual machine ‘power’ events

    -   1: identifier\(s\)

    -   2: ‘power’ on

    -   3: ‘power’ off \(including restart flag\)

-   c: virtual machine deletion

    -   1: identifier\(s\)

-   d: virtual machine resource modification events:

    -   1: CPU addition/removal

    -   2: RAM addition/removal

    -   3: Networking additional/removal

    -   4: Storage mount/dismount/resize


### 6. Orchestrator events

Log Collection Principle\(s\): 3, 6

Orchestrators such as Cloud Foundry and Kubernetes create and manage a variety of technology resources to facilitate an application environment.

-   a: resource creation \(including templates\)

    -   1: identifier\(s\)

    -   2: resource type

    -   3: operating system image information \(if applicable\)

-   b: container ‘power’ events

    -   1: identifier\(s\)

    -   2: ‘power’ on

    -   3: ‘power’ off \(including restart flag\)

-   c: resource deletion

    -   1: identifier\(s\)

-   e: resource modification events:

    -   1: identifier\(s\)


### 7. Allocation of IP address leases from DHCP services

Log Collection Principle\(s\): 3, 5

DHCP services must be configured to create and forward the following:

-   a: successful client DHCP requests, including:

    -   1: Requesting client MAC address

    -   2: DHCP scope identifier

    -   3: IP address leased

    -   4: IP address lease duration

-   b: unsuccessful client DHCP requests, including:

    -   1: Requesting client MAC address

    -   2: DHCP scope identifier \(if applicable for unsuccessful request\)


## Enhanced Maturity Tier

### 1. Firewall log data for denied network traffic

Log Collection Principle\(s\): 5

All firewall `DENY` log data must be forwarded.

-   a: client IP address

-   b: firewall/router identifier

-   c: request response code

-   d: request content, including:

    -   1: IP protocol \(for example, ICMP\)

    -   2: destination/target port

    -   3: destination/target IP address

    -   4: destination/target hostname address \(if reverse lookup performed\)


### 2. Internal DNS namespace zone content

Log Collection Principle\(s\): 4

Internal domain name spaces must ultimate forward, in an [RFC5936 \(DNS Zone Transfer Protocol \(AXFR\)](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5936) compatible format including all information described in the RFC.

### 3. DHCP scopes \(and the functional segmentation of each\)

Log Collection Principle\(s\): 5

Machine-readable DHCP scope exports \(and surrounding metadata/description of the purpose of each scope\) must be created and forwarded.

### 4. Endpoint protection security logs

Log Collection Principle\(s\): 6

Security log data \(as defined by the vendor\) must be created and forwarded.

### 5. Security-related logs for all Windows-based end-user devices

Log Collection Principle\(s\): 6

Security-related logs, as defined by [NCSC’s Logging Made Easy template](https://github.com/ukncsc/), from all end-user devices operating a Microsoft Windows operating system must be created and forwarded.

### 6. Mobile device enrollment activity

Log Collection Principle\(s\): 1, 2, 3, 6

Where a mobile device management solution is used and end-user devices register/enrol and de-register/de-enrol with it, enrollment data should be created in and forwarded.

-   a: enrolment or un-enrolment event type

-   b: end-user device identifier\(s\), such as client IP address and/or MAC address and/or assigned DHCP name

-   c: end-user account name \(if applicable\)


### 7. VPN concentrator activity data

Log Collection Principle\(s\): 3, 5

Where VPN services are in use, connection-related log data must be created and forwarded.

-   a: success or unsuccess status

-   b: user/certificate identifier

-   c: client IP address

-   d: concentrator identifier


### 8. Pipeline events

Log Collection Principle\(s\): 1, 2, 3, 6

Continuous integration and continuous deployment pipelines obey instructions to manage hosting environments and are a privileged position to oversee all tenant resources, they must be highly auditable to clarify activity and attribute the same.

-   a: source identifier\(s\)

    -   1: user\(s\)

    -   2: repository

-   b: activity events

    -   1: resource creation

    -   2: resource destruction
