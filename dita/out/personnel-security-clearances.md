# Personnel security clearances

## Baseline Personnel Security Standard \(BPSS\)

Unless otherwise agreed formally by the Ministry of Justice \(MoJ\) in writing, any person \(whether MoJ staff, contractor or through supply chain\) who has access to, or direct control over, MoJ data must have satisfactorily completed the baseline.

The [BPSS is published on GOV.UK](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/government-baseline-personnel-security-standard).

## National Security Clearances

The MoJ will advise on a case-by-case basis if an individual requires a [national security vetting and clearance](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/security-vetting-and-clearance#applicant).

The MoJ does **not** have a standing requirement for system administrators or application developers to maintain Security Check \(SC\).
