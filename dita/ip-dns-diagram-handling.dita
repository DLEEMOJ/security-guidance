    <title>OFFICIAL-SENSITIVE? Not by default</title>
    <body>
      <p>The <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/mojlong"/> does <b>not</b> consider its IP address, DNS or architectural information to be <codeph>SENSITIVE</codeph> (a handling caveat within the <codeph>OFFICIAL</codeph> information classification) <i>by default</i>.</p>
      <p>In some contexts, this information may be considered sensitive (usually when combined with other information), for example, "Server X on IP address x.x.x.x has not been security patched for 5 years and there are known vulnerabilities which are unmitigated and thus could actively be exploited in this moment."</p>
      <p>IP addresses of connecting clients (for example, the IP address of the computer of a general member of the public accessing a public <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/moj"/> digital service) <i>may</i> be Personal Data.</p>

      <body>
        <p>IP addresses, DNS information &amp; architecture documentation can generally be sent via email services that enforce adequate in-transit integrity/encryption without any additional security protections such as the use of ZIP files.</p>
