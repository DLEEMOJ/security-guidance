      <p>All <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/mojlong"/> employees interact with information,
        and are responsible for its protection.
        Information security must be considered during the process of designing,
        maintaining,
        and securing the <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/moj"/>'s IT systems that are used to process information.</p>
      <p>However,
         not all information warrants the strictest levels of protection.
         This is why information classification is so important to the <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/moj"/> â€“
         to ensure that the department can focus its security efforts on its most sensitive information.
         Information security must be proportionate to the security classification of the information,
         and must be considered throughout the information lifecycle to maintain its confidentiality,
         integrity,
         and availability.</p>

    <title>Classifying information</title>
    <body>
      <p>The three information security classifications the <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/moj"/> uses are <codeph>OFFICIAL</codeph>,
        <codeph>SECRET</codeph>,
        and <codeph>TOP SECRET</codeph>.
        This follows the <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/hmggovernmentsecurityclassifications"/>.</p>
      <p>Each information security classification has a minimum set of security measures associated with it that need to be applied.
        These security measures might change,
        depending on the information lifecycle stage.</p>

      <p>It is important to understand that security classification is determined by the level of risk in case of loss or unauthorised access,
        and not by the type of information.</p>
      <p>It is the responsibility of the Data Owner to classify the data.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Most production data is <codeph>OFFICIAL</codeph> information.
          Within this,

        <li>Most personal data is <codeph>OFFICIAL</codeph> information.
          Within this,
          some personal data might be classified as <codeph>SECRET</codeph> information if it meets the risk threshold defined.</li>

        <p>Information security classification may change throughout the information lifecycle.
          It is important to apply appropriate security classifications and continually evaluate them.</p>
        <p>The consequences of not classifying information correctly are outlined below:
        <ul>
          <li>Applying too high a marking can inhibit business operations,
            such as collaboration,
            and lead to unnecessary and expensive protective controls being applied.</li>
          <li>Applying too low a marking may result in inappropriate controls,
            and may put sensitive assets at greater risk of compromise.</li>
          <li>Incorrect disposal can lead to unauthorised access to information.
            Disposal of information should be done using approved processes,
            equipment or service providers.
            <ph audience="audience-tech">Refer to the <xref href="data-destruction.dita" format="dita"><ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/moj"/> Data Destruction guide</xref> to understand when the disposal should be witnessed and recorded.</ph></li>

        <p>All of the <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/moj"/>'s information is,
          at a minimum,
          <codeph>OFFICIAL</codeph> information.
          It is very likely that the information you create and use in your <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/moj"/> day-to-day job is <codeph>OFFICIAL</codeph> information.</p>
        <p>Examples include:
        <ul>
          <li>Routine emails you send to your colleagues.</li>
          <li>Information posted on the intranet.</li>
          <li>Supplier contracts.</li>
          <li>Information and data you use to build a database,

            record types,

        <p><codeph>OFFICIAL-SENSITIVE</codeph> <q>whilst not a formal classification</q>,
          should be used sparingly,
          so that its effectiveness is not weakened.
          This is especially important when you consider that <codeph>OFFICIAL</codeph> is already well-protected.</p>
        <p>Use <codeph>OFFICIAL-SENSITIVE</codeph> when you want to remind users to be careful when handling information.

      <body>
        <p>When deciding whether it is appropriate or desirable to reclassify information,
          a useful model is to consider what audience might get value from accessing the information.
          For example,

          then the information might well be best classified as <codeph>SECRET</codeph>.
          Alternatively,
