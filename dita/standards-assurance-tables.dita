  <title>Standards Assurance Tables</title>
  <body>
    <p>The <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/mojlong"/> Cyber Security team have developed a 'Standards Assurance Table' (SAT) in the form of a Google Sheet template.</p>
    <p>The SAT measures technology systems (and surrounding information governance) against the <xref href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/cabinet-office" format="html" scope="external">UK Cabinet Office</xref> <xref href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/the-minimum-cyber-security-standard" format="html" scope="external">Minimum Cyber Security Standard (MCSS)</xref> and <xref href="https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/" format="html" scope="external">UK National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC)</xref> <xref href="https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/collection/cloud-security?curPage=/collection/cloud-security/implementing-the-cloud-security-principles" format="html" scope="external">Cloud Security Principles (CSPs)</xref>.</p>

      <p>The SAT itself is written to be self-explanatory to a cyber security professional who is already aware of the MCSS/CSP and has a familiarity with information risk management concepts.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>Black labelled sheets describe the SAT and how it should be used</p>

          <p>Blue labelled sheets are the ones to complete</p>

    <title>Key SAT concepts</title>
    <body>
      <p>The SATs have measures including "Objectives", "Evidence", "Confidence", an overall "Delta" (which is the most pertinent SAT output) and "Further Evidence Required", with supporting commentary.</p>
      <p>The primary SAT purpose is to help assess a system against the MCSS/CSP. It is used to determine confidence whether or not the evidence demonstrates the system is compliant (or not).</p>
      <p>Evidence is analysed to determine confidence that the evidence demonstrates the system meets (or does not meet) the standards. It also indicates the 'gap' (delta) between the system's posture according to said evidence and the standards.</p>
    </body>
    <topic id="objectives">
      <title>Objectives</title>
      <body>
        <p>The MCSS/CSPs have been distilled into 39 objectives. The Assessor (normally a cyber security professional) completes the SAT by evaluating the target system against the objectives.</p>
        <p>The <xref href="identify-protect-detect-respond-recover.dita" format="dita" type="topic">categories used within the MCSS</xref> are discussed seperately.</p>
        <p>Objectives are templated. This means they can be added to but existing objectives must not be deleted or edit in-place.</p>
      </body>
    </topic>
    <topic id="evidence">
      <title>Evidence</title>
      <body>
        <p>To avoid assessments that are ultimately anecdotal, the assessor will only rely upon written evidence.</p>
        <p>Evidence can come in the form of transcribed conversations, diagrams, documentation or other auditable information about a system.</p>
        <p>Evidence might not be directly related to the system itself but form a part, for example, where there is a wider document that is not system orientated but which describes who is relevant role holders currently are.</p>
        <p>Evidence is described as being 'Held', 'Partial', 'Not Held' or 'N/A' (where the Objective is not applicable to the system being assessed).</p>
      </body>
    </topic>
    <topic id="confidence">
      <title>Confidence</title>
      <body>
        <p>The assessor reviews the evidence and uses their professional opinion to indicate a Confidence Score.</p>
        <p>The Confidence Score uses a scale from 0 (no confidence at all) to 14 (high level of confidence), or 'N/A' (where the Objective is not applicable to the system being assessed).</p>
      </body>
    </topic>
    <topic id="delta">
      <title>Delta</title>
      <body>
        <p>The Delta Rating is the resulting 'distance' between the assessed system posture against an Objective and the confidence of the same.</p>
        <p>Mathematically, the final Delta Rating is N/A (where the Objective is not applicable to the system being assessed) or 0 to 14 (inc).</p>
        <p>A wide delta (higher numerical value) indicates that the Objective is not met. A narrow delta (lower numerical value) indicates that the Objective is closer to being met.</p>
        <p>The Delta Rating is automatically calculated as '14 minus Confidence Score'.</p>

    <topic id="further-evidence-required">
      <title>Further Evidence Required</title>
      <body>
        <p>The assessor indicates what further evidence <i>types</i> in their view are required based on the evidence they have thus far.</p>
        <p>The <xref href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1oO9RAZQ6ETsN2iHZb5zcFM0HROliw18MBv89oF-BPeg/edit#gid=679100590" format="html" scope="external">Further Evidence Required (Help) sheet</xref> has a calculator which the assessor will use.</p>
        <p>The data point is currently a unique number to assist with future automated analysis. The format and range of values for the data point is currently under active review and so subject to change without notice.</p>

    <title>Understanding the Objectives, gathering evidence for the assessor</title>
    <body>
      <p>Teams/individuals responsible for the design, creation, implementation, support and maintenance of systems should have viable written evidence (regardless of format) that should be made available to various teams on request, for example, security or to internal audit.</p>
