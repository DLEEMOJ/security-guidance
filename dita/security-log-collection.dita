    <body>
      <p>The <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/moj"/> Cyber Security team operate a centralised, scalable, multi-tenant, cloud-based log collection and forwarding system for infrastructure (non-application level) log data.</p>
      <p>The platform can receive, store, index, filter, search, alert and re-forward log data from any <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/moj"/> source (including supplier systems).</p>

    <title>Additive technology supply chain</title>
    <body>
      <p>The security log collection principles are designed to be met through technology supply chain as opposed to each system individually.</p>
      <p>For example, where the principles require the logging of DNS traffic, this could be achieved within a corporate device ecosystem by logging at the end user device itself, or by configuring the end user device to use a corporate DNS server that logs instead.  You may decide to do both, because some DNS queries can go out without the DNS server (for example in the case of a corporate VPN that is not always on).</p>
      <p>Where a platform exists, it should provide some assurance to all its consumers that makes clear what logging it collects and what needs to be logged by its tenants.</p>
      <p>For example, if a cloud platform allows you to spin up arbitrary virtual machines, but guarantees that all network traffic must pass via a web proxy to go out, which logs, then the cloud platform can tell you that <xref href="#network-traffic-events" format="dita">Principle 5: Network Events</xref> and <xref href="#infrastructure-events" format="dita">Principle 3: Infrastructure Events</xref> are logged, but that you need to provide <xref href="#authentication-events" format="dita">Principle 1. Authentication Events</xref>. The platform may even provide you with a base virtual machine which have logging for authentication events built in, meaning that you don't need to provide any logging at that level.</p>
