      <p>Backing up is an essential part of protecting <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/mojlong"/> Information and Communication Technology (ICT or IT) resources. Backing up provides a means of recovering a system or data to a known state, or point in time. In other words, backups enable you to restore a system or data to be effectively indistinguishable from how it was on a particular date and time.</p>
      <p>All systems MUST comply with the <xref href="https://intranet.justice.gov.uk/guidance/security/it-computer-security/ict-security-policy-framework/" format="html" scope="external">HMG Security Policy Framework</xref>.

      <p>All IT systems MUST be evaluated to determine if a backup schedule is required. This depends on the data stored, and on legal or other regulatory requirements. The evaluation and resulting decision regarding backup requirement MUST be documented for the system.</p>
