      <p>Not everyone has access to an <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/mojlong"/> device which can be used remotely. In these extraordinary times, exceptional provision is being developed for you to use your own devices for work purposes.</p>
      <p>Until that provision is in place, you must not use a personal device for work purposes.</p>

          <p>Some teams within the <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/moj"/>, such as groups within Digital &amp; Technology, and HMCTS, might already have prior permission to use personal devices for aspects of software and service development work.
