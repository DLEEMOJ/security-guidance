    <title>Introduction</title>
    <body>
      <p>This guide explains the technical security controls that should be implemented on information systems developed, procured or operated by the <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/mojlong"/> or on its behalf.
      This guide aligns with <xref href="https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-53r4.pdf" format="pdf" scope="external">NIST 800-53</xref> and the NCSC <xref href="https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/collection/caf/cyber-safety-introduction" format="html" scope="external">Cyber Assessment Framework (CAF)</xref>.
      The guidance provides the <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/moj"/> with 3 phases or layers of defence.
      These controls must be implemented to ensure the <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/moj"/>'s network infrastructure is secure.</p>
