        <body>
            <p>The <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/mojlong"/> has a large number of outsourced service providers,
            varying from applications,
            infrastructure,
            payment processing,
            document printing,
            1st,
            2nd and 3rd line support.
            These suppliers may utilise their services being supported or hosted onshore or offshore. 
            Onshore means within the United Kingdom (UK).
            Offshore means outside the borders of the UK.</p>
            <p>Some contracts,
            and the underlying policies and processes,
            might need to be varied according to circumstances.</p>
            <p>Offshoring services includes collecting,
            transferring,
            storing and processing <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/moj"/>

            data and information.
            This includes personal, financial and legal information.</p>
            <p>Privacy,
            Security,
            Commercial,
            and Legal risks associated with offshoring must be reviewed,
            and appropriate controls put in place to reduce or mitigate any weaknesses.</p>

            <title>Definition of Offshoring</title>
            <body>
                <p>Offshoring is where any part of the service delivery relating to data is conducted outside the UK,
                and is therefore potentially subject to non-UK controlled legislation,
                standards,
                governance and compliance.</p>
                <p>This relates to:
                <ul>
                <li>Where data and services are physically located.</li>
                <li>Where the individuals who manage the services - including the development, maintenance, applications and processing systems - are located.</li>
                <li>Who has access to the data.</li>
                </ul></p>

            <ol>
                <li>Obtain the necessary approvals:
                    <ul>
                        <li>For agency or departmental specific services or applications,
                            approval is required from the relevant Agency or Departmental SIRO (Senior Information Risk Officer).</li>
                        <li>For wider <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/moj"/> services or applications that involve more than one department or agency,
                            approval is required from the <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/moj"/> Senior Information Risk Officer (SIRO) and Senior Security Advisor (SSA).</li>
                        <li>All projects additionally require approval from the <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/moj"/> Chief Information Security Officer (CISO),
                            the <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/moj"/> Data Protection Officer (DPO),
                            and from <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/moj"/> Commercial and <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/moj"/> Legal teams.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>If all those approvals are obtained and documented, the project can continue as planned.</li>
                <li>If one or more of the required approvals cannot be obtained, then the project request is rejected. The Service Owner must then do one or more of:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Adjust plans so that approval is granted.</li>
                        <li>Escalate to their Departmental Head, providing more detail to support the case for approval.
                            Any residual or inherent risk must be rectified before escalating.</li>
                        <li>Provde additional or alternative mitigations, to address concerns and so enable approval.</li>
                    </ul></li>
                <li>Perform continual monitoring and improvement of services,
                    and appropriate risk management associated with service providers.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>For existing contracts, consider how to work with what is already in place, reflecting its criticality to the <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/moj"/>.
                Consider what variations might be required for contacts, and the cost or other implications for doing so.</p>
