  <title>Criminal Justice Secure Mail</title>
  <body>
    <p>The <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/mojlong"/> operates the CJSM service to enable those people working in the Justice system who do not have access to a suitable email service to exchange information in a safer way.</p>
    <p>The <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/moj"/> does <b>not</b> require the use of CJSM where other suitably secure and efficient means can be used. It is considered a safe option to enable communication but it is only an option.</p>
