    <title>Minimum user clearance requirements</title>
    <body>
      <p>Most of the <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/moj"/> IT systems are able to process <codeph>OFFICIAL</codeph> information. Therefore all roles in the <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/moj"/>
require staff to attain BPSS clearance as a minimum to be
granted access rights to view <codeph>OFFICIAL</codeph> information. Some roles require staff to have higher clearance.</p>
      <p>For an individual to perform any of the following tasks, clearance higher than BPSS is required:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Has long term, regular, unsupervised access to data centres or communications rooms.</li>
        <li>Has regular privileged unsupervised and unconstrained access to systems which contain data for multiple <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/moj"/> systems, for example backups, or console access to multiple cloud services.</li>
        <li>Has cryptography responsibilities and handling, under advice from the Crypto Custodian.</li>
        <li>Has access to multiple system security testing outcomes which reveal vulnerabilities in live services.</li>
        <li>Has a role such as system support or IT investigation role, such that without further authority or authorisation, an individual might:
          <ul>
            <li>Act as another user.</li>
            <li>Obtain credentials for another user.</li>
            <li>Directly access other users' data.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>If an individual does not need to perform any of the above tasks, then BPSS, DBS or Enhanced Check is sufficient.</p>
      <p>The <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/moj"/> HQ and Executive Agencies might have additional, specific requirements for DV/DV STRAP clearance for individual systems. These requirements should be followed where applicable.</p>
      <p>Please contact the Cyber Assistance Team and refer to the <xref href="https://intranet.justice.gov.uk/guidance/hr/recruitment/security-vetting/" format="html" scope="external">Vetting Policy</xref> for further information.</p>
