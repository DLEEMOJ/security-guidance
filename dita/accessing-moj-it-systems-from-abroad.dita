	<title>Accessing <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/mojlong"/> IT Systems From Abroad</title>
	<body>
		<note>This guidance information applies to all staff, contractors and agency staff who work for the <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/moj"/>.</note>
		<note importance="high">If you are national security cleared to 'Enhanced SC' or DV levels, follow this process for all your trips,
			regardless of whether they are for business or personal reasons.</note>
		<p>As a government official travelling overseas, you should consider that you may be of interest to hostile parties regardless of your role. By following <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/moj"/> policies and processes, you can help reduce the risk to yourself and limit the damage of exposure of sensitive information.</p>
		<p>In general, it is acceptable for <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/moj"/> users to access <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/moj"/> services from abroad, and to do this using their <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/moj"/> equipment. But before you travel, consider:<ul>
			<li>Do you need to take <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/moj"/> IT equipment abroad or access <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/moj"/> IT systems to do your job?</li>
			<li>Can the business need be met in another way or by someone else?</li>
			<li>If you just need to manage your inbox while away, can you delegate permissions to your inbox to a colleague to manage on your behalf?</li>
			<li>Have you left enough time to check and obtain necessary approvals? The process can take several weeks, depending on the circumstances. This is because it may be necessary to apply additional technical controls to protect you, your device, and any data the device can access. </li>

			<p>While travelling, you might incur roaming charges when using your <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/moj"/> equipment for calls or accessing services. These charges can be expensive, and must be paid by your Business Unit. This is another reason for having a good business need to take <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/moj"/> equipment abroad.</p>
			<p>By default, <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/moj"/> equipment is not enabled for use abroad. Before travelling, contact the <xref href="#contacts" format="dita"><ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/moj"/> Phone and Mobile Devices</xref> team. Ask them to enable International Roaming, and to activate the remote wipe function. This helps protect the <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/moj"/> equipment in case of loss or theft.</p>

			<p>Contact the <xref href="#contacts" format="dita">Service Desk</xref> immediately. Tell them if the <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/moj"/> equipment is lost, stolen or was potentially compromised. This includes any time the equipment is deliberately removed out of your sight, such as by a customs official.</p>
			<p>If any security-related incident occurs overseas, regardless of whether it involves <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/moj"/> equipment, you should contact <xref href="#contacts" format="dita">Corporate Security Branch</xref> as soon as possible.</p>
			<p>For any emergency outside normal UK business hours, contact the <xref href="#contacts" format="dita">Duty Security Officer</xref>.</p>
			<p>If there is a problem with your <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/moj"/> equipment, it might be necessary to disable your ability to connect to the <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/moj"/> network or services from your device. The Service Desk will do this if required. <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/moj"/>-issued phones might still have some functionality, to let you make phone calls, but the device should be treated as compromised and not used any more for any <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/moj"/> business.</p>
