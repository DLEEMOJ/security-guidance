  <title>Enterprise Access Control Policy</title>
  <body>
    <p>All <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/mojlong"/> staff (including contractors and agency staff) are entitled to be granted access to the information which is required for their work, subject to their level of clearance and employment status.</p>
    <p>Access control mechanisms provide the ability for <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/moj"/> IT systems to control the levels of access granted to an individual User or defined groups of individual Users. This section outlines the process for managing User access to <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/moj"/> IT systems starting from when a User is initially registered through to the revocation of access rights and removal of their User account.</p>

    <title>User and Information Access management</title>
    <body>
      <p>Access control is primarily about enforcing three information security principles:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>The <i>'need-to-know'</i> principle – restricting access to information based on a business requirement.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><i>Non-repudiation</i> of User actions –holding a User accountable for their actions on an IT system.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>The <i>'least privilege'</i> principle – assigning the least number of privileges required to fulfil their work.</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>At a high level, access control in <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/moj"/> is based on Role Based Access Control (RBAC). Each user is assigned a role (or set of roles) and access to a piece of information is granted on a per role basis. In general, information will either be subject to RBAC or classified as open access (for example, a HR policy document made available on the <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/moj"/> intranet).</p>
      <p>Information made available on an open access basis (i.e. not subject to any RBAC restrictions) must be treated as an exception to general access control rules. It is important to ensure any information made available in this way has been validated by the Information Asset Owner (IAO) to ensure that the information does not have 'need-to-know' constraints that impede it's sharing beyond a defined RBAC group (see <xref href="#it-system-owner-information-asset-owner-responsibilities" format="dita">here</xref>for further details on the role of the IAO).</p>

      <body>
        <p>The following activities must be undertaken for each new User registration:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>The identity of the new User must be confirmed – for an <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/moj"/> member of staff this is confirmed by <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/moj"/> HR;</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>The access rights required must be supplied (for example, the list of RBAC groups and/or applications);</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Confirmation of clearance level (see <xref href="#minimum-user-clearance-requirements" format="dita">here</xref> for further details);</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>The application for User registration must be authorised by a <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/moj"/> senior manager.
              <note>This authorisation is used as confirmation of the Users identity and the access rights requested are correct.</note></p>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>In general, individuals who are <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/moj"/> staff (including contractors and agency staff) will be provisioned with a User account and a number of roles applicable to the nature of their work so that they can access the relevant <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/moj"/> IT systems, application and information. Temporary use of a <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/moj"/> IT system may be permitted where a specific business need exists (e.g. to allow an external trainer to train <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/moj"/> staff in a new application) subject to clearance checks and a Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA). A <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/moj"/> senior manager must assume total responsibility for the actions undertaken by that temporary User while they are using a <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/moj"/> IT system using a temporary account.</p>

          <p>Most <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/moj"/> IT systems operate at IL3 where information with a protective marking of REST* can be processed.

          <p>For the purposes of this standard, access rights have been broken down into three User account types. Table 1 provide a description for each type and the minimum clearance required.</p>

        <body>
          <p>Systems administrators by their very nature have privileged access to <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/moj"/> IT systems, it is important that the use of system administrative accounts is kept to a minimum, as such:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>Systems administrators must be provisioned with two system accounts, one operates as a normal user, the other as a systems administrator.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>A systems administrator must ensure that they use their normal account as their main working account and only use the elevated privileges of their systems administrator account when required.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>Further details can be found in <xref href="https://intranet.justice.gov.uk/guidance/security/it-computer-security/ict-security-policy-framework/system-administrators/" format="html" scope="external">IT Security SyOPs - System Administrators</xref>.</p>

          <p>Non-IT service provider Users are not normally permitted to hold system administrative privileges.
