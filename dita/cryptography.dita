        <li>
          <p>All data <b>must</b> employ adequate and proportionate cryptography to preserve confidentiality and integrity whether data is at-rest or in-transit.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Existing cryptographic algorithms (and implementations thereof) should be used - at the highest possible abstraction level.</p>

    <title>In-transit</title>
    <body>
      <p>In-transit encryption techniques can both protect data during transit through cryptography but also help facilitate the establishing of identity of devices on one or more sides of the connection.</p>

        <p>Tools such as <xref href="https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/" format="html" scope="external">Qualys SSL Server Test</xref> and Check TLS services from <xref href="http://www.checktls.com/index.html" format="html" scope="external">checktls.com</xref> <b>must</b> be used where applicable to help identify most common issues and configuration problems.</p>
        <p>While these tools are not a replacement for skilled testing, the outputs of these tools can help you identify inefficient or insecure configurations which should be considered for remediation.</p>
        <p>Configurations should be periodically re-validated.</p>

    <title>At-rest</title>
    <body>
      <p>At-rest encryption techniques can protect data while being stored and even during some processing. At-rest techniques usually protect against physical theft or attack methods.</p>

      <title>Server-based</title>
      <body>
        <p>Local storage (such as operating system locations) and filestores (such as storage area networks) should be considered for at-rest encryption to help mitigate again physical interception (such as theft) threats.</p>
        <p>Given the autonomous nature of server provisioning and management, it may not always be technically practical to implement such encryption (particularly when a physical server restart would require human intervention with a decryption passphrase).</p>
        <p>In general, at-rest encryption <b>must</b> always be proportionally considered, even if documented as not reasonable to implement.</p>

        <body>
          <p>Vendor managed at-rest encryption <b>must</b> be enabled by default unless there is a good reason not to (for example, licensing restrictions or severe performance issues).</p>
          <p>Vendor managed at-rest encryption (the vendor will typically managed encryption keys, on-the-fly encryption and decryption) is preferred, shifting management to the vendor under the shared responsibility model.</p>
          <p>In some circumstances, it <i>may</i> be reasonable to self-managed encryption keys but should be relatively rare.</p>

      <body>
        <p>Portable storage such as CDs, DVDs and USB sticks can be safely used to move data. As usual, data must be adequately protected based on the overall governance and information risk requirements.</p>
        <p>While the following certifications are preferred, they may not be required based on the data and data methods being stored or transported.</p>

      <title>Portable end-user devices</title>
      <body>
        <p>Portable end-user devices such as laptops, tablets and smart phones must utilised at-rest encryption to protect on-board data (and subsequent configured accounts) while the device is 'locked' or powered down.</p>
        <p>The <xref href="https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/guidance/end-user-device-security" format="html" scope="external">NCSC End-user Device Security Collection</xref> discusses per-platform configuration advice.</p>
        <p>Summarily, native at-rest encryption must be enabled with a suitable and proportional decryption code (typically, a password) and hardware-backed cryptography is preferred.</p>

        <p>Data that should be kept confidential or is worthwhile to otherwise obfuscate should be hashed. This <b>must</b> apply where authentication credentials are stored, such as a password.</p>
