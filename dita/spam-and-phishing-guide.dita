    <title>Protecting a parked domain</title>
    <body>
      <p>DMARC <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/policymust"/> also be
      implemented on non-email sending domains.
      This is because the domains might be used for email spoofing and
      phishing.</p>
      <p>Once parked domains are protected,
        configure them to renew automatically by default.</p>
      <p>If you are a domain owner,
        to protect a parked domain follow these steps:
        <ol>
          <li>Create an SPF record with no permitted senders.
            This means that no IP address is authorised to send email for the
            parked domain.</li>
          <li>Include an <codeph>RUA</codeph> address.
          Aggregate reports can be sent to this address.
          The reports provide visibility of potential abuse.</li>
          <li>If you have an <codeph>A</codeph> record on your domain,
          but no <codeph>MX</codeph> records,
          create a "null" <codeph>MX</codeph> record that immediately fails
          any email to the parked domain.
          Give the <codeph>MX</codeph> record the highest priority
          (<codeph>0</codeph>).</li>
        </ol>
      </p>
      <p>A "null" DKIM record is not required.
      This is because email will be treated the same as if it had no record at
      all.
      However,
      recipients might treat a "null" DKIM record with extra caution,
      as it explicitly revokes any keys that might be cached.</p>
      <p>Some interfaces might not allow you to implement all these steps.
        Implement as many as possible.</p>

        <p>Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attacks might result in unauthorised access

  <topic id="email-sandboxing">
    <title>Email sandboxing</title>
    <body>
      <p>Sandboxing provides an additional layer of protection.
        Any email that contains URLs,
        attachments,
        or suspicious senders can be securely checked for malicious content
        before they reach the network or mail server.
        If the email is found to be harmful,
        it is not sent further.
        Sandboxing is beneficial,
        because it:
      <ul>
        <li>Mirrors the end user's computer,
          and provides a secure space to interact with and analyse potentially
          harmful communications.</li>
        <li>Allows developers and technical architects to be proactive in
          minimising the effect of a threat.</li>
      </ul></p>
      <p>For further guidance on implementing sandboxing,
        including which products you might use,

  <topic id="url-link-rewriting">
    <title>URL link rewriting</title>
    <body>
      <p>URL link rewriting is a technique used to detect malicious links in
        emails.
        Links in emails are actively scanned.
        They are then rewritten to point to an Advanced Threat Protection
        gateway,
        where two checks occur:
      <ol>
        <li>Determine if the link is deny-listed by the
          <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/moj"/> or has been previously
          identified as malicious.</li>
        <li>Scan downloadable content available at the link address.</li>
      </ol></p>
      <p>After the checks have completed,
        the user continues to the URL or is blocked from access,
        depending on the results of the checks.
        If access is blocked,
        URL rewriting is used to provide an explanation and contact details for
        additional help.</p>
