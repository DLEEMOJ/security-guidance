  <title>Enterprise IT - Infrastructure</title>
  <body>
    <p>We have developed a series of logging requirements for Enterprise IT infrastructure, such as underlying networks, network services and directory services at different maturity tiers in order to support defensive cyber security, such as detecting breaches.</p>

      <title>1. User directory services</title>
      <body>
        <p>Log Collection Principle(s): 1, 2</p>
        <p>User directory services (such as Active Directory (AD), Azure Active Directory or OpenLDAP must create and forward Authentication and Authorisation events from the directory service itself.  (Normal authentication and authorisation events for the underlying operating system and server should be forwarded as appropriate.)</p>
        <p>For example:
        <ul>
          <li>An administrator logging onto the AD server using the local end-user device's administrator account should result in an authentication event for the machine being sent.</li>
          <li>A directory admin logging on to the AD service from their end-user device without logging into the local machine should generate an authentication event for the directory.</li>
        </ul></p>
        <p>These event types must be logged and forward:
        <ol>
          <li>Account creation</li>
          <li>Account lockout</li>
          <li>Account reinstatement</li>
          <li>Account authentication failures</li>
          <li>Account authentication successes after 1 or more failures</li>
          <li>Account password changes</li>
          <li>Group membership addition / deletion (in particular, any group that gives admin access)</li>
          <li>Group creation</li>
          <li>Privilege modification for users (changes to ACL's, granting of new roles in RBAC models)</li>
          <li>Privilege escalation events (use of sudo, UAC)</li>
          <li>Multi-factor authentication state, such as:
            <ol>
              <li>Enabled</li>
              <li>Disabled</li>
              <li>Reset/rotation</li>
              <li>Recovery method used</li>
            </ol>
          </li>

      <title>2. Productivity Suite security logs</title>
      <body>
        <p>Log Collection Principle(s): 1, 2, 3, 6</p>
        <p>Productivity suites (such as <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/gsuite"/> or Microsoft Office 365) must create and forward all security-related log data (as defined by the vendor), including unsuccessful  Authentication and Authorisation events.</p>
        <p>For example, within an Office 365 tenancy with Conditional Access enabled and set to require multi-factor authentication when a user device is perceived to be outside of the corporate network and such prompt is made and the outcome of that challenge.</p>

      <title>3. Domain name service query logs</title>
      <body>
        <p>Log Collection Principle(s): 4</p>
        <p>DNS query logs must be created and forwarded.
        <ol>
          <li>Client IP address</li>
          <li>Query</li>
          <li>Query response content including:
            <ol>
              <li>Returned record(s) or NXDOMAIN</li>
              <li>Authoritative nameserver</li>
            </ol>
          </li>
          <li>Query response code</li>
          <li>Zone and/or view identifier (if local zone response and/or multiview)</li>
        </ol></p>
        <p>This remains true for where nodes (for example, servers) may bypass internal DNS services.</p>
