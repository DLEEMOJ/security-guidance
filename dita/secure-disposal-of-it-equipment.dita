  <title>Secure Disposal of IT Equipment</title>
  <body>
    <p>The <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/mojlong"/> and its Executive Agencies and Arms Length Bodies use a wide variety of equipment,
      including desktop computers, laptops, USB memory sticks and other mobile devices.
      This equipment is procured and managed though <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/moj"/> suppliers,
      who are normally responsible for the secure disposal of the equipment when it is no longer used.
      Typically,
      a supplier managed device will have a supplier asset tag on it,
      making it easier to identify who to ask for help with disposal.</p>
    <p>However,
      there are also other devices across the <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/moj"/> estate
      which might have been procured and managed locally.
      It is crucial that they are disposed of in a secure manner,
      to prevent data being leaked.</p>
    <p>To determine the correct disposal requirement,
      use the following table to identify the correct outcome,
      depending on the type of equipment and its security classification.
      If the table does not cover your exact requirement,
      contact the Operational Security Team: <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/ostemail"/></p>

    <note audience="audience-tech">Theoretically, data deletion is possible on some RW-capable media.
      For simplicity, however,
      the safer assumption is that rewriting and therefore data deletion is not possible on optical media.</note>
    <p>Owners of the data storage devices are responsible for procuring services that meet the necessary destruction outcomes as described above.
      Assurance shall be required that the appropriate destruction has taken place for
      any locally procured <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/moj"/> assets,
      and that an audit trail is available for inspection
      upon request by <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/moj"/> security.</p>
    <p>Wherever possible and appropriate,
      managers should pool together equipment with that of local colleagues to share service costs.</p>
