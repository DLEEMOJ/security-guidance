        <p>The aims of this policy are to:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>Maximise the effectiveness of any digital incident investigation which may be required, normally as a result of a security incident;</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Help protect <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/moj"/> information assets through the application of best practice in IT Forensics;</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Minimise the cost and impact on the business of a forensic investigation;</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Manage the risks associated with forensic investigations, and, the risks inherent in the incident(s) that occurred, necessitating the investigation.</p>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>IT forensics is the application of techniques to detect and react to types of security incidents that require the collection, storage, analysis and preparation of digital evidence that may be required in legal or disciplinary proceedings.</p>
        <p>The use of IT forensics as a course of action is linked to decisions made during an IT security incident. As such, this policy is linked to, and should be read in conjunction with, the <xref href="it-incident-management-policy.dita" format="dita">IT Security - IT Incident Management Policy</xref>.</p>
        <p>This policy outlines the requirements to collect, preserve and analyse data in a systematic, standardised and legally compliant fashion to ensure the admissibility of evidence in a legal case, dispute or disciplinary hearing relating to an incident.</p>

        <p>Other than as required by the <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/moj"/>'s obligations under UK law, all decisions to forensically monitor or investigate a potential security incident must be justified by a risk analysis relating to the need to obtain forensically sound evidence, followed by a cost benefit analysis of how much the required evidence will cost to collect, and what benefit it provides.</p>

          </li>
          <li>
            <p>A reactive investigation - Where a suspicious incident has been identified (or reported). These investigations require the appropriateness, legality, effects of business disruption, cost and availability of key resources to be considered before the investigation is started.</p>

        <p>The following forensic principles are based on <xref href="https://www.app.college.police.uk/app-content/investigations/linked-reference-material/" format="html" scope="external">ACPO guidelines</xref>:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>Preservation of Evidence - The forensic investigation process needs to preserve the integrity of the original evidence by providing sufficient security, legal advice and procedural measures to ensure that evidential requirements are met. Any processes applied to copies of evidence must be repeatable and achieve the same results.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Aptitude for the task - Any task in a forensic investigation will need to be conducted by a person who is suitably trained and competent to carry out that task.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Documented Methodology â€“ All investigations need to follow a documented methodology, as outlined in a Forensic Readiness Plan, with an audit trail of all processes applied to collect evidence. A chain of evidence will need to be created and preserved to demonstrate where evidence has been stored and under whose responsibility from capture until presentation. This allows other investigators to repeat those processes to obtain the same results as required.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Conformance - Investigations need to be conducted in a manner which is inline with <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/moj"/> policies (this includes all <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/moj"/> corporate policies, not just IT Security policies).</p>

      <title>External reporting and escalation</title>
      <body>
        <p>For major incidents it is necessary to consider escalating the forensic investigation process to external bodies, including:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>Other Government Agencies (if common assets are affected, or if there are consequential effects);</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Law Enforcement;</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>CESG, including GovCertUK and CINRAS;</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Cabinet Office (as part of the annual returns required by the SPF);</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p><ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/moj"/> legal advisors.</p>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Responsibility for escalation normally resides with the Information Asset Owner (IAO) who may also be in charge of the incident investigation. Where responsibility for an investigation has been escalated to the DSO or SIRO, further escalation responsibility will also reside with them.</p>
        <p>The impact upon any relevant ongoing operational activity has to be considered before external reporting and escalation is invoked. The forensic investigation process needs to allow for the chain of evidence to be passed to outside agencies (e.g. a law enforcement agency).</p>
