        <p>This policy complements the <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/moj"/> overall security policy.</p>
        <p>This Public Protest Policy applies to all employees, contractors, partners and service providers, including those on co-located sites and sites owned by other public bodies. This includes employees of other organisations who are based in, or work at, <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/moj"/> occupied premises.</p>
        <p><codeph>POL.PPD.001</codeph>: Agencies and arm's length bodies (ALBs) <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/policyshall"/> comply with this corporate framework but <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/policycan"/> establish their own arrangements tailored to operational needs and <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/policyshould"/> supplement the framework with local policy or guidance for any business-specific risk.</p>

    <title>Scope and Definition</title>
    <body>
        <p>Protests take different forms, ranging from action by one person acting alone to a demonstration attended by thousands of people. In some instances, the <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/moj"/> might have advance notice of a public protest, in other instances the protests might be unannounced or spontaneous. This policy aims to ensure that the response to all protests are managed proportionately and consistently.</p>

    <title>Context</title>
    <body>
        <p>Freedom of speech and the right to peacefully protest is protected by law, both under common law and the Human Rights Act 1998. However, freedom of speech and the right to peacefully protest are not absolute, and the exercise of those rights can be restricted provided any restrictions:
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Are prescribed in law.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Are necessary and proportionate.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Pursue one or more of these aims:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <p>The interests of national security or public safety.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>The prevention of disorder or crime.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>The protection of health or morals.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>The protection of other's rights and freedoms.</p>
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul></p>
        <p>The rights of those protesting need to be balanced with the rights of others to go about their business without fear of intimidation or having serious disruption to their community.</p>
        <p>The <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/moj"/> <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/policymight"/> be the subject of protests and demonstration by various activist groups seeking publicity for a specific cause or case.</p>
