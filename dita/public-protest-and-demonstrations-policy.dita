          <p>This Public Protest Policy applies to all employees, contractors,
partners and service providers, including those on co-located sites
and sites owned by other public bodies. This includes
employees of other organisations who are based in, or work at,

    <title>Scope and Definition:</title>
    <body>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <p>Protests take different forms, ranging from action by one person
acting alone to a demonstration attended by thousands of people. In
some instances, the <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/moj"/> might have advance notice of a
public protest, in other instances the protests might be unannounced or spontaneous.
This policy aims to ensure that the response to all protests are
managed proportionately and consistently.</p>

          <p>Freedom of speech and the right to peacefully protest is protected
by law, both under common law and the Human Rights Act 1998.
However, freedom of speech and the right to peacefully protest are
not absolute, and the exercise of those rights can be restricted
provided any restrictions:</p>

          <p>The level of risk and potential impact to <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/moj"/> assets and most
importantly physical harm to our people and the public
determines the controls to be applied and the degree of assurance
required. The <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/moj"/> <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/policymust"/>
              ensure a baseline of physical security measures
are in place at each site and receive annual assurance that such
measures are in place to provide appropriate protection to all
occupants and assets, and that these measures can be strengthened
when required, such as in response to a security incident or change in
the Government Response Level.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>The implementation of all security measures <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/policymust"/> be able to provide
evidence that the selection was been made in accordance with the
appropriate information security standards ISO27001/27002, Physical
Security advice taken from the <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/cpnilong"/> and <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/gov007"/>.</p>

        <li>
          <p>The constantly changing security landscape has necessarily dictated
that Physical Security measures be constantly re-evaluated and
tested in order to meet new threats and other emerging
vulnerabilities. This policy and subsequent supporting standards
              <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/policyshall"/> be subject to annual review or more frequently if warranted.</p>
