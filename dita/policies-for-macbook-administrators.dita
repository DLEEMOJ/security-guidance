    <p>All User accounts are created as 'Admin' to allow for software installation as part of normal business requirements.</p>
    <p>Each laptop has a separate Admin account (created on build) to allow for User deletion and password resets</p>
    <p>These policies must be adhered to by all Macbook Fleet Administrators.</p>

    <title>Why?</title>
    <body>
      <p>These policies ensure two things:
      <ol>
        <li>That administrators have a clear understanding of what is considered acceptable, so that they do not inadvertently perform an administrative action which is later considered unacceptable.</li>
        <li>In the event that a security incident does occur in relation to the Macbook Fleet, that there is a clear policy which can be referred to, to support any action that is taken.</li>
      </ol></p>
