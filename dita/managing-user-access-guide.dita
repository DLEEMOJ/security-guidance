    <title>Managing access to <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/moj"/> systems</title>
    <body>
      <p>The following methods can be used to manage access to the <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/moj"/>'s systems. They are in order of preference for their use, with 1 providing more secure management features than 3.</p>

      <p>Use of bastion or 'jump' boxes for access into systems is a useful technical security design that also helps 'choke' and control sessions.</p>
      <p>The need to use remote server configuration tools to interact with a server or node can be reduced through improved infrastructure and server design. For instance, the use of stateless cluster expansion or contraction, and the automated diagnostic data capture, can reduce the need to use SSH.</p>
      <p>System Admins should only login to a server or node via SSH to execute commands with elevated privileges (typically, root) under exceptional circumstances.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>SSH must be strictly controlled, and environments should be segregated so that no single bastion or 'jump' SSH server can access both production and non-production accounts.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Do not allow direct logging in as root through SSH. Administrators must have a separate account that they regularly use and <codeph>sudo</codeph> to root when necessary.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>SSHs must be limited to users who need shell, in contrast to users who might use SSH as a port forwarding tunnel.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Joiners/Movers/Leavers processes must be strictly enforced (optimally and preferably automated) on SSH servers, as they are a critical and privileged access method.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>SSH access should not be password-based. It should use individually created and purposed SSH key pairs. Private keys must not be shared or re-used.</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>The Government Digital Service (GDS) recommends the use of the open authorisation standard '<xref href="https://oauth.net/2/" format="html" scope="external">OAuth2</xref>' as a means to authenticate users. See the <xref href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/gds-api-technical-and-data-standards" format="html" scope="external">GDS guide</xref> for more information.</p>
