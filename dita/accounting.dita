    <title>Security-related log data retention</title>
    <body>
      <p>Log data created and processed for information security purposes should be retained for no longer than 2 (two) years by default (this is subject to any legislative or regulative compliance requirements) but for a minimum of 6 months.</p>
      <p>These times are generalistic as a guide, and require contextual analysis particularly where Personal Data is involved.</p>
