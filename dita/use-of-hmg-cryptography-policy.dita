    <body>
      <p>This document is the <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/mojlong"/> IT Security â€“ Use of HMG Cryptography Policy. It provides the core set of principles, expectations, roles and responsibilities for using HMG cryptographic material.</p>

      <body>
        <p>Each policy statement outlines a security requirement and where applicable, a reference is provided to further material. A unique identifier is associated with each statement for easy reference. The format of each statement is illustrated below:</p>
          <dl>
              <dlentry>
                  <dt>POL.CRYPTO.XXX</dt>
                  <dd>Policy statement text.</dd>
              </dlentry>
          </dl>
        <p>The policies outlined in this document form the baseline standard. However this policy is not a replacement for HMG Information Assurance Standard No. 4 - Management of Cryptographic Systems [Ref, 2]. HMG IAS4 remains the primary reference source where this policy provides a supplement to it.</p>

      <title>Scope</title>
      <body>
        <p>This policy is concerned with the use of HMG cryptographic material used on any <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/moj"/> IT system and/or where HMG cryptographic material is obtained through the <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/moj"/>.</p>

    <topic id="purpose" >
      <title>Purpose</title>
      <body>
        <p><ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/moj"/> uses a wide range of cryptography products or various classifications and is serviced by several suppliers. This policy is intended to supplement the HMG IAS4 [Ref, 2] and assist suppliers to procure encryption from CESG and manage its life cycle.</p>

    <topic id="audience" >
      <title>Audience</title>
      <body>
        <p>Anyone who wants to obtain encryption from CESG and everyone who is, or needs to be, CRYPTO or ACCSEC authorised (see glossary) to handle Key Variables (KV) or hardware.</p>
        <p>In accordance with HMG IAS4 [Ref, 2] encryption is only provided for fully accredited systems. There are long lead times to obtain encryption products from CESG (which fluctuate between 8-12 weeks and are always subject to change). It is recognised that there needs to be some flexibility in the process to order encryption and this guide helps meet that requirement.</p>

      <body>
        <p>As soon as the need for encryption is identified the system Accreditor, the COMSO must be informed by the Project Manager and agreement sought for the need for the hardware, software and encryption from CESG.</p>
        <p>The process requires that an applicant is appointed and that applicant is responsible for ensuring that the product is suitable for the requirement and it is their responsibility to familiarise themselves with the CESG Security Operating Procedures (SyOPs) for that product. The applicant can delegate this element to someone else but that person must be identified to the other parties of this approval process.</p>
          <dl>
              <dlentry>
                  <dt>POL.CRYPTO.003</dt>
                  <dd>The Project Manager <b>must appoint</b> an applicant. Exceptionally, the applicant can be the Project Manager. The applicant <b>must contact</b> the vendor of the encryption product and obtain the latest version of the CESG macro enabled word application form to complete.</dd>
              </dlentry>
          </dl>
        <p>This form must be completed by the applicant with a full explanation of the requirement and attached with, if appropriate, a diagram (e.g. MS Visio diagram) which explains the solution and this must be sent to the COMSO, Accreditor and <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/moj"/> Crypto Custodian for approval with the application form.
            <note>The applicant is responsible for ensuring that the product is suitable and meets the desired business requirement.</note></p>
        <p>If the solution requiring encryption has not yet been Accredited (at the time the application is being drafted), or if the current RMADS need to be updated to accommodate this requirement, a timetable must be set out for the delivery of draft RMADS and SyOPs, this <b>must be</b> attached to the application form.</p>
        <p>The COMSO and Accreditor must both approve and notify the <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/moj"/> Crypto Custodian in order for the form to be sent to CESG for processing.</p>
        <p>If any of the conditions above have not been met the form cannot be processed and this may cause delays.</p>
        <p>Further processing is required by the <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/moj"/> Crypto Custodian and upon dispatch to CESG the <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/moj"/> Crypto Custodian will give the applicant a reference number (hereafter referred to as the IAB account number) which must be referred to in any future communications regarding the requirement.</p>
