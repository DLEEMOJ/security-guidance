      <p>The <xref href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/security-policy-framework" format="html" scope="external">UK HMG Security Policy Framework</xref> mandates protective security outcomes that the <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/moj"/> must achieve (and suppliers to <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/moj"/>, where they process <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/moj"/> data/information).</p>

      <title>IDENTIFY</title>
      <body>
        <p>IDENTIFY is a prerequisite standard that requires:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>appropriate information security governance processes;</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>identification and cataloging of information held/processed; and</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>identification and cataloging of key operational services provided.</p>

    <topic id="protect">
      <title>PROTECT</title>
      <body>
        <p>PROTECT is the core standard to provide fundamentally defences to information and requires:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>access to systems and information to be limited to identified, authenticated and authorised systems/users;</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>systems to be proportionally protected against exploitation of known vulnerabilities; and</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>highly privileged accounts (such as administrative level) to be protected from common attacks.</p>
          </li>
        </ul>

    <topic id="detect">
      <title>DETECT</title>
      <body>
        <p>DETECT is the core standard to detect when attacks are taking, or have taken, place and requires:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>capture event information (and apply common threat intelligence sources, such as <xref href="https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/cisp" format="html" scope="external">CiSP</xref>);</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>based on PROTECT, define and direct monitoring tactics to detect when defence measures seem to have failed;</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>detection of common attack techniques (such as commonly known applications or tooling); and</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>implementation of transaction monitoring solutions where systems could be vulnerable to fraud attempts.</p>
          </li>
        </ul>

    <topic id="respond">
      <title>RESPOND</title>
      <body>
        <p>RESPOND is the core standard to define the minimum of how organisations should respond to attacks and requires:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>development and maintenance of an incident response &amp; management plan (including reporting, roles and responsibilities);</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>development and maintenance of communication plans, particularly to relevant supervisory bodies, law enforcement and responsible organisations such as the NCSC;</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>regular testing of the incident response &amp; management plan;</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>assessment and implementation of mitigating measures on discovery of an incident (successful attack); and</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>post-incident reviews to ensure feedback into the iteration of the incident response &amp; management plan.</p>
          </li>
        </ul>

    <topic id="recover">
      <title>RECOVER</title>
      <body>
        <p>RECOVER is the core standard to define the minimum of how organisations should recover from an attack once it has been considered closed, and requires:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>identification and testing of contingency mechanisms to ensure the continuance of critical service delivery;</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>timely restoration of the service to normal operation (a plan to do so, and testing of that plan);</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>from DETECT &amp; RESPOND, immediately implementing controls to ensure the same issue cannot arise in the same way again, ensuring systematic vulnerabilities are proportional remediated.</p>
          </li>
