    <title>Protecting your workspace and equipment</title>
    <body>
      <p>Remote working is when you work from any non-<ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/moj"/> location, for example, working at home. It's important to think about confidentiality, integrity and availability aspects as you work. This means protecting equipment, and the area where you work.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Always:</b>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>Keep <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/moj"/> equipment and information safe and secure.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Protect <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/moj"/> information from accidental access by unauthorised people.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Lock or log off your device when leaving it unattended. For long periods of non-use, shut down your device.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Keep your workspace clear and tidy - follow a 'clean desk policy', including paperwork, to ensure <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/moj"/> information isn't seen by unauthorised people.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Use <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/moj"/> IT equipment for business purposes in preference to your own equipment such as laptops or printers.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Be wary of anyone overlooking or eavesdropping what you are doing.</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <b>Never:</b>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>Let family or other unauthorised people use <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/moj"/> equipment.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Leave equipment unattended.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Work on sensitive information in public spaces, or where your equipment can be overlooked by others.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Advertise the fact that you work with <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/moj"/> materials.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Take part in conference or video calls when you are in public or shared spaces such as cafes or waiting rooms.</p>
        </li>
        <li>

      <p>It's important to consider the security of how you work remotely.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p><b>Work locations</b> - as with home working above, you need to be equally, if not more, vigilant when working in public spaces.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><b>Confidentiality</b> - be aware of others eavesdropping or shoulder surfing, both what you are working on and what you are saying eg conference and video calls.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Keep <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/moj"/> <b>equipment and information</b>, including printouts and documents, safe and secure.</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>Even when working remotely, you must still follow the security policies and operating procedures for <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/moj"/> systems you access and work with.</p>

    <title>Using your own equipment</title>
    <body>
      <p>The main guidance is available <xref href="personal-devices.dita" format="dita" type="topic">here</xref>.</p>
      <p>Wherever possible, you should always use official <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/moj"/> equipment for business purposes. Never send work material to your personal email accounts.</p>
      <p>If you are working remotely, or do not have access to <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/moj"/> equipment, it might be tempting to use your own equipment, especially printers. The advice is to avoid printing anything, and in particular not to use personal printers.</p>
      <p>However, if you really must print <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/moj"/> information, you:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>should connect directly to the printer using USB, not WiFi</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>should not print out personal information relating to others</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>should consult the information asset owner or line manager before printing the information</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>must store any and all printed materials safely and securely until you return to <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/moj"/> premises, when they must be disposed of or filed appropriately</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><b>must never</b> dispose of <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/moj"/> information in your home rubbish or recycling</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>Basically, think before you print.</p>

    <title>Privacy</title>
    <body>
      <p>It is important to protect privacy: yours and that of the <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/moj"/>. Events like the Covid-19 (Coronavirus) pandemic are often exploited by people wanting to get access to sensitive or valuable information. This often results in an increase in attempts to get access to personal information or <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/moj"/> accounts, using phishing and email scams. Be extra vigilant whenever you get an unexpected communication.</p>
      <p>Be aware of your working environment when you work with <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/moj"/> information. If anyone might see the data, or hear you talk about it as you use it, that could cause privacy problems. Be aware of SMART devices around your remote location, and ensure they are switched off if conducting video or voice communications.</p>
      <p>Guidance and suggestions for improving Privacy appear throughout this guide, but it's worthwhile highlighting these points:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>Lock your computer, even when unattended for short periods.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Think about whether an unauthorised person, such as a family member, might see the information you are working with.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Don't write down passwords. Use a password manager.</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
