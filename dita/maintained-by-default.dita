    <p>We believe that technology should be Maintained by Default, particularly in relation to security.</p>

    <title>Good technical maintenance is security maintenance</title>
    <body>
      <p>Technical maintaince isn't just about patching or upgrades (but they often play a large and important part of maintenance) but more of refreshing designs, methods and approaches to leverage new technologies to increase quality, speed and performance and reducing costs.</p>
      <p>Good technical maintenance (including patching and upgrades) includes security benefits whether that is patching a known security issue through to implementating newer cryptography methods that both benefit security but also reduce computational effort or enhance user privacy.</p>
      <p>Good technical maintenance (just like other release or change paths) should include an appropriate amount of testing (outside of production) to understand any negative consequences of changes.</p>

    <title>Commodity technical maintenance</title>
    <body>
      <p>The <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/mojlong"/> expect technology systems to be maintained to ensure the commodity functional elements do not become end of life, or cease function as a result.</p>
      <p>Examples include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>[automated] certificate renewals</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>upgrading of hashing methods to implement new standards once they become commoly accepted best practices</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>upgrading from SSLv3 to TLS, and from TLS1.[0/1] to TLS1.2, ultimately into TLS1.3 (and beyond)</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
