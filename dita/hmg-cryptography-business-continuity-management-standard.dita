      <title>Background</title>
      <body>
        <p>All HMG encryption is procured from CESG which is the National Technical Authority for Information Assurance and is based in GCHQ. It is typically produced to support a <xref href="https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/information/products-cesg-assisted-products-service" format="html" scope="external">CESG Assisted Products Service (CAPS)</xref> product which means that it has gone through rigorous testing to give HMG assurance that it is secure. HMG Cryptography is produced under special circumstances to provide additional assurance and that process, distribution and storage of this material is protected and secure.</p>
        <p>HMG has specific standards on the management of Crypto and other associated products called the HMG IS4, it is the policy of the <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/moj"/> to follow and comply with HMG IS4 and this document is intended to support and augment that standard.</p>

      <title>Segregation and supersession</title>
      <body>
        <p>Key variables that are issued from CESG are typically issued with two editions. The first is for immediate deployment and the second is for emergency supersession. In the case of hard disc encryption the supplier holds the live edition and the <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/moj"/> Crypto Custodian holds any others. All supplier crypto deployment environments are not at the same site as the <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/moj"/> Crypto Custodian and this provides natural segregation of the editions.</p>
        <p>Eclypt uses a lifetime key variable and does not have more than one edition, In the event of compromise, the usual CINRAS report and request to CESG for emergency replacement of the key variable will be required.</p>

      <p>All encryption is stored in a <xref href="https://www.cpni.gov.uk/" format="html" scope="external">CPNI (Centre for the Protection of the National Infrastructure)</xref> Class 4 safe which also has a certified 2 hour burning time. Above the safe is a fire suppressant sprinkler system.</p>
      <p>Access to the safe is strictly limited to the <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/moj"/> Crypto Custodian and the Alternate Crypto Custodian. A copy of the master code for the safe is stored with the Departmental Security Officer. Only the DSO or ITSO are permitted to open the safe in the event of an emergency.</p>

        <p>The area that the <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/moj"/> Custodian works is open plan in an accredited IL3 environment. The DSO has further accredited the immediate area surrounding the <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/moj"/> Crypto Custodian in 5.31 of 102 Petty France for Crypto Management on the understanding that the personnel surrounding them are SC cleared and because there are desks immediately by the safe to allow a clear line of site from the Custodianâ€™s desk to the safe.</p>
        <p>All key variables must be kept in the safe and only removed when specific action is required on a key variable.</p>
