			<p>This article provides guidance on passwords within the <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/mojlong"/>.
			It helps you protect <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/moj"/> IT systems by telling you about choosing and using passwords.
			Whenever you see the word 'system' here, it applies to:
			<ul>
				<li>Hardware, such as laptops, PCs, servers, mobile devices, and any IT equipment.</li>
				<li>Software, such as the Operating System, or applications installed on hardware, or mobile device applications (apps).</li>
				<li>Services, such as remote databases or cloud-based tools like <xref href="https://slack.com/" scope="external" format="html">Slack</xref>.</li>
			</ul></p>
			<p>This password guidance is for all users. <ph audience="audience-tech">It also includes more detail for system administrators or developers.</ph></p>

			<p>The <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/moj"/> password guidance follows <xref href="https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/guidance/using-passwords-protect-your-data" scope="external" format="html">NCSC guidance</xref>. The NCSC recommends a <xref href="https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/guidance/password-guidance-simplifying-your-approach" scope="external" format="html">simpler</xref> approach to passwords. Some agencies or bodies might have specific requirements or variations. Check your team Intranet or ask your Line Manager for more information.</p>
			<p>Follow the <xref href="https://www.cyberaware.gov.uk/passwords" scope="external" format="html">CyberAware advice</xref> to generate your passwords. Always use a separate and unique password for each account or service.</p>
			<p>The most important points to remember are that passwords should be:
				<ul>
					<li>At least 8 characters long.</li>
					<li>No more than 128 characters long.</li>
					<li>Not obvious.</li>
					<li>Not a dictionary word.
						A combination of dictionary words might be suitable, such as '<codeph>CorrectHorseBatteryStaple</codeph>'.</li>
					<li>Unique for each account or service.</li>
				</ul></p>
			<p>If a system or another person provides you with a password, change it before doing any <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/moj"/> work on that system.
				Examples of 'single-use' passwords include:
				<ul>
					<li>Your own account on a work-provided laptop.</li>
					<li>A shared account for accessing a data analytics service.</li>
					<li>All supplier or vendor supplied accounts.</li>
				</ul>
			</p>
			<p>You must change a password whenever:
				<ul>
					<li>There has been a security incident involving your account or password. For example, someone guessed your password, or you used it on another account.</li>
					<li>There was a security incident with the service that you access using the password. For example, if someone broke into the system that provides the service you use.</li>
					<li>Your line manager or other authorised person tells you to do so.</li>
				</ul>
			</p>
			<p>When required to change a password, you must do so as soon as possible.
			If you don't change the password soon enough, you might be locked out of your account automatically.
			The following table shows the maximum time allowed:
			<table>

		<title>Password expiry</title>
		<body>
			<p>You don't have to change a password because it is old. The reason is that time-expiry of passwords is an <xref href="https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/blog-post/your-password-expiry-policy-may-have-reached-its-expiry-date" scope="external" format="html">...outdated and ineffective practice</xref>.</p>
			<p>Some current or legacy systems don't allow passwords that follow <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/moj"/> guidance. For example, some mobile devices, laptop hard drive encryption tools, or older computers might not be able to support a mix of character types. For such systems, choose passwords that are as close as possible to <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/moj"/> guidance.</p>

			<p>Use a password manager to help you keep track of your passwords.</p>
			<p>These are tools that help you create, use, and manage your passwords. A useful overview is available <xref href="https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/blog-post/what-does-ncsc-think-password-managers" scope="external" format="html">here</xref>.</p>
			<p>As passwords become more complex, and you need to look after more of them, it becomes increasingly necessary to use a password manager. For example, development teams in <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/moj"/> Digital &amp; Technology use <xref href="using-lastpass.dita" format="dita" type="topic">LastPass</xref>.</p>
			<p>You still need to remember one password.
			This is the password that gets you into the manager application.
			Once you have access, the application works like a simple database, storing all the passwords associated with your various accounts and services.
			Some managers have extra features, such as password generators.
			Some managers can even automatically fill-in username and password fields for you when during log in.</p>
			<p>The password manager database is often stored in the cloud so that you can use it anywhere.
			The database is encrypted, so only you can open it.
			That's why your single password key is so important.
			Without it, you can never get access to the password database again.</p>
			<p>Using a password manager for your <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/moj"/> account and service details is recommended.</p>
			<p>You can find additional useful information about password manager tools <xref href="password-managers.dita" format="dita" scope="local">here</xref>.</p>

			<p>Suppliers and vendors must ensure that systems support the password requirements.
			Systems must be able to issue, change, reset, and revoke passwords.
			This must be possible using well-defined and fully-described processes.
			Supply enough information and procedures to fulfil <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/moj"/> password policy.</p>
			<p>The <xref href="https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/guidance/password-guidance-simplifying-your-approach" scope="external" format="html">NCSC guidance</xref> for simplifying passwords says that forcing complex passwords has:
				<ul>
					<li>Marginal security benefit.</li>
					<li>A high user burden.</li>

			<p><xref href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-factor_authentication" scope="external" format="html">Multi-factor Authentication (MFA)</xref> provides extra security for login and access controls. MFA is also referred to as Two-Factor Authentication or 2FA.</p>
			<p>Use MFA in systems for privileged or important step confirmation. For example, the user must enter their MFA code when deleting a record.</p>
			<p>Follow the <xref href="https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/guidance/multi-factor-authentication-online-services" scope="external" format="html">NCSC guidance</xref> for enabling MFA.</p>
			<p>Use <xref href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time-based_One-time_Password_algorithm" scope="external" format="html">Time-based One-Time Password Algorithm (TOTP)</xref> or hardware and software tokens. If possible, avoid using SMS or email messages containing one-time login codes. If TOTP applications, or hardware- or software-based tokens, are not available to you, then SMS MFA or email MFA is still better than no MFA.</p>
			<p>Systems must offer MFA alternatives to users where they are available. For example, MFA codes sent by SMS are not suitable if mobile devices are not allowed in the room or building.</p>

		<title>Extra measures</title>
		<body>
			<p>Check that a system, service, or information protected by a password is not <xref href="official-official-sensitive.dita" scope="local" format="dita">classified</xref> as <codeph>SECRET</codeph> or <codeph>TOP SECRET</codeph>. Make sure that it doesn't contain delicate material. Examples include contracts, or personal data or information. If it does contain such material, you might need extra access control.</p>
			<p>Check which other systems have access to the system or service. Make sure that the access control suits the material at both ends of the connection.</p>
			<p>Appropriate extra measures might include tokens or other multi-factor authentication devices. Think about using an existing authentication system other than passwords. Avoid creating new authentication systems. Try to reduce what a user must remember. For more information about authentication, see the <xref href="authentication.dita" format="dita" scope="local">Authentication</xref> guide.</p>
			<p>A technical risk assessment helps identifies extra controls for systems. This is mandatory for systems that need formal assurance. Multi-user systems are also subject to a Business Impact Assessment (BIA). For example, an assessment might find that you need extra checks for logging in to an account or service. The checks might depend on various factors such as:
			<ul>
				<li>Time of login.</li>
				<li>Location of login.</li>
				<li>Number of previous connections from the connecting IP address.</li>
				<li>Whether to allow more than one login at a time.</li>
			</ul></p>

			<ul>
				<li>Biometrics.</li>
				<li>Tokens.</li>
