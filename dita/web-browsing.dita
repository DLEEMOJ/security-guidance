    <p>The <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/mojlong"/> provides access to the Intranet and Internet for business use.
      The access helps you to do your job effectively and efficiently.
      <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/moj"/> security policies governs your use of these facilities.</p>

    <title>What websites can I access?</title>
    <body>
      <p>The <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/moj"/>'s approach to website access is continually reviewed and updated.
        By default,
        we try to allow access to as much as possible of the internet for all users.
        Inevitably, there are some restrictions, for the following reasons:
        <dl>
          <dlentry>
            <dt>Cyber Security</dt>
            <dd>The site is an unacceptable security risk for <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/moj"/> systems or users.
              For example, sites known to host malware are blocked.</dd>
          </dlentry>
          <dlentry>
            <dt>Technical</dt>
            <dd>The site causes technical issues which interfere with business activities.
              For example, a video site uses too much network capacity.</dd>
          </dlentry>
          <dlentry>
            <dt>Business Policy</dt>
            <dd>Only a specific individual or group of users can access the site.
              For example,
              social media sites are blocked for systems or users in frontline roles.</dd>
          </dlentry>
        </dl></p>
      <p>The list of websites included in each of the categories is as small as possible.
        But if you cannot access a site that you think should be OK,
        you can <xref href="#what-to-do-if-you-are-blocked-from-a-website-that-you-think-should-be-ok" format="dita">request a review</xref>.
        Similarly,
        if you can access a site that you think should be blocked,
        <xref href="#what-to-do-if-you-are-able-to-access-a-website-that-you-think-should-be-blocked" format="dita">request a review</xref>.</p>
      <p>The access rules that apply are described in <xref href="https://intranet.justice.gov.uk/guidance/security/it-computer-security/web-browsing-security-policy-profiles-new/" format="html" scope="external" platform="html">this document</xref><xref href="web-browsing-security-policy-profiles.dita" format="dita" platform="epub pdf">detail here</xref>.</p>

      <p>Log an incident with your <xref href="#general-enquiries-including-theft-and-loss" format="dita">Service Desk</xref>.</p>
      <p>Provide the following details:
      <ul>
        <li>The address of the website.</li>
        <li>The time you visited the site.</li>

      <p>The Service Desk will investigate the reason why you cannot access the website.</p>
      <p>If there was a system error or fault,

      <p>If the block is due to an access rule,
