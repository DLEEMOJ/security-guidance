    <title>Storing data on laptops</title>
    <body>
      <p>The guidance applies to all <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/mojlong"/> staff.</p>
      <p>If you need to store data on your computer you should always remember to move it into:
        <ol id="storage-preference">
          <li>Your local Electronic Document and Record Management (EDRM) system.</li>
          <li>An <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/moj"/> shared drive.</li>
          <li>Your <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/moj"/>-provided 'home' drive.</li>
        </ol>
        Do this as soon as you can next connect to the <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/moj"/> network.</p>

    <title>Where should I save data when using a laptop?</title>
    <body>
      <p>It is best to avoid saving any data on a laptop hard drive.
        However, if you absolutely must, you should always remember to copy or move the data to
        the <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/moj"/> network as soon as you next can connect to it,
        either via secure remote access or by direct connection.</p>
      <p>In order to avoid potential data loss, save data in:
        <ol conref="#storing-data-on-laptops/storage-preference"><li/></ol>
      </p>
      <p>There is a better chance of recovering lost data if you have saved it to
        the <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/moj"/> network,
        as data stored on the <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/moj"/> network is backed up daily.</p>

    <title>What is the impact of hard drive failures?</title>
    <body>
      <p>Hard drive failures can lead to the irrecoverable loss of data.
        Any data loss can have security implications for the <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/moj"/>,
        and a significant impact on:
