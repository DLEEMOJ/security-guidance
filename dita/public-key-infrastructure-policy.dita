        <p>Within the <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/mojlong"/>, there are a number of requirements for Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) services to support confidentiality, integrity and authentication. This document defines the mandatory policy requirements for PKI use.</p>
        <p>The policy contained in this document refers specifically to PKI Services used for the following functions:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>PSN Wide Area Network VPN cryptography</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Server-side certificates for:</p>

            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>User and Device Certificates for Network Access Control using 802.1x EAP/TLS</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>User certificates for digital signature functions</p>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>For PKI Services in respect of other functions, including RAS VPNs, contact the appropriate system Accreditor or <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/moj"/> Crypto Custodian.</p>

      <title>Out of Scope</title>
      <body>
        <p>Any information or component, which operates at SECRET or TOP SECRET (e.g. Private Keys with a classification above OFFICIAL-SENSITIVE) fall outside of the scope of this policy</p>
        <p>Certificates used for authentication of users or organisations used in token or PKI based authentications systems other than 802.1x are out of scope.</p>

                  <p>System and Product Assurance: Products should be assured to a formal evaluation recognised by the Authority and appropriate to the sensitivity of the material being processed. For cryptographic material this is normally CESG Assisted Products Scheme (CAPS) or CESG Product Assurance (CPA). Other assurances, such as FIPS 140-2 (Level 2 or better) may be permitted in some cases and, in exceptional circumstances, other forms of assurance may be considered. Where system assurance is required, at the discretion of the Accreditor, then a formalised process will be necessary, e.g. Bespoke Assurance by a CESG approved company. In some cases, again at the discretion of the Accreditor, an IT Health Check may be scoped to provide the necessary assurance.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>Service Assurance: The security aspects of the service e.g. forensic readiness, auditing, accounting, processes and procedures will be assured through the formal process of accreditation.</p>

              <p>The Registration Authority (RA) shall identify, validate and authorise PKI Customers, i.e. organisations that are permitted to make certificate signing requests of the PKI Service. The RA shall also identify, validate and authorise nominated representatives of the PKI Customer, i.e. individuals who are authorised to represent the PKI Customer in respect of the PKI Services. Authorisation will be dependent upon a mutual agreement between the Authority and the PKI Customer specifying the conditions for registration. This may be in the form of a Memo of Understanding or a formal contract.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>Subordinate Registration Authorities, i.e. those that register entities at a lower level in the trust authority than the root, must comply with any obligations set by the root authority, including the right of the root authority to audit compliance.</p>

            <li>
              <p>Identity validation shall comply, where possible, with HMG Good Practice Guide 45 (Identity Proofing and Verification of an Individual) and Good Practice Guide 46 (Organisational Identity).</p>

            <li>
              <p>A Registration Authority shall register each authorised organisation requesting certificates for subordinate CAs. On registration, the Registration Authority shall ensure that the registered party is provided with the Certificate Policy of the required service. The registered party shall provide a Certificate Practice Statement in response.</p>

            <li>
              <p>The PKI Customer must notify the RA when any of their nominated representatives are no longer authorised to access the services. Individuals will become unauthorised if their security clearance is expired or revoked, if their employment is terminated, if they are under investigation for malpractice, or if they no longer work on the <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/moj"/> account.</p>

              <p>Auditing and accounting of RA functions must be carried out in accordance with HMG Good Practice Guide 13. The integrity and confidentiality of accounting logs must maintained to British Standard BS 10008 as appropriate for legal admissibility of evidence, in the event that disputes need to be heard in a court of law.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>For online submission of CSR and CRR the RA shall use two-factor authentication to authenticate and authorise enrolled users.</p>

              <p>The CSR/CRR shall be approved by one person (e.g. ComSO) and actioned by another (e.g. Crypto Custodian), except in cases where this process is automated.
