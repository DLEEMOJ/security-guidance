    <title>Information Security Framework</title>
    <body>
        <p>The department's information security is managed via:</p>
        <p>    
            <ol>
            <li>This strategic policy,</li>
            <li>Associated informtion security policies related to specific topics.</li>
            <li>Standards and procedures accompanied by supporting governance arrangements.</li>
            <li>Guidance that helps interpret the above in different circumstances.</li>
            <li>System and process-specific security policies and guidance.</li>
            </ol>
        </p>
        <p>MoJ-wide security policies are all outcome-focussed and avoid being specific to allow a range of methods to be used to achieve them, tailored to local circumstances. This permits agencies and teams within the department flexibility and autonomy in interpreting them given their particular operations.</p>
        <p>The policies and standards should be treated as the minimum baseline that areas need to achieve. In many circumstances, additional controls may be required to meet specific regulations or contractual obligations, or to counter particular threats.</p>

    <title>Policy Statement</title>
    <body>
        <p>The MoJ is entrusted with vast quantities of private and sensitive information relating to the operation of the justice system. The department recognises that it is vital that all such information must be properly protected from compromise of its confidentiality, integrity or availability.</p>
        <p>Everyone within the scope of this policy must ensure that:</p>
        <p>
            <ul>
            <li>Data is properly identified, classified and protected in accordance with the MoJ's security policies and standards. All data must be properly protected with security controls proportionate to the risk to that data. All information assets have a responsible owner, the Information Asset Owner, whose responsibilities are defined in [xxxx].</li>
            <li>All technology services are protected through security controls as detailed in the relevant MoJ standards.</li>
            <li>Information security incidents and 'near misses' are quickly identified, managed effectively to minimise harm, and lessons are learned from them to reduce future problems. This is undertaken in accordance with the [Incident Management AUP].</li>
            <li>When the MoJ uses service providers or other partners who have access to departmental information, the Senior Responsible Officer (SRO) must ensure that an appropriate security risk assessment is undertaken to ensure the supplier or partner complies with relevant departmental security policies, and any deviations are understood in terms of risk.</li>
            <li>Where security risks are identified, the SRO ensures effective and proportionate security controls are in place manage these risks.</li>
            <li>Information back-up and disaster recover/business continuity plans are in-place and tested in accordance with the MoJâ€™s [business continuity / disaster recovery standard] to ensure destructive or disruptive security events cause minimal interruption to operations.</li>
            <li>All MoJ staff and users within scope of this policy will:
                <ul>
                <li>complete regular information security training</li>
                <li>undertake role-specific security training as required</li>
                <li>take all reasonable steps to keep the department's information protected against unauthorised or accidental disclosure</li>
                <li>seek help if they are unsure how to implement any aspect of the MoJ security policies or guidance.</li>
                </ul></li>
