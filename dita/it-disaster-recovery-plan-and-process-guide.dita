        <p>The ability of the <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/moj"/> to react quickly to ITDR events will ensure that losses are minimised and the business will be able to resume or continue operations as quickly as possible.</p>
        <p>ITDR management is the ability to react to ITDR events in a controlled, pre-planned manner. Preparation and planning are key factors to successful incident management and all <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/moj"/> systems will rely upon the development and implementation of an ITDR plan as described in this guide.</p>
        <p>The HMG Security Policy Framework (SPF) Mandatory Requirement 4 states that:
        <lq>"Departments and Agencies must have robust and well tested policies, procedures and management arrangements in place to respond to, investigate and recover from security incidents or other disruptions to core business."</lq></p>
        <p>The policy on IT Disaster Recovery is covered in <xref href="it-disaster-recovery-policy.dita" format="dita">IT Security Policy – IT Disaster Recovery Policy</xref> while this document sets out the <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/moj"/> guidance for creating an ITDR plan. This guide must be read in conjunction with CESG GPG No. 24 – Security Incident Management and <xref href="incident-management-plan-and-process-guide.dita" format="dita">IT Security – Incident Management Plan and Process Guide</xref>.</p>
        <note>The <xref href="it-disaster-recovery-policy.dita" format="dita">IT Security Policy – IT Disaster Recovery Policy</xref> sets out the roles and responsibilities with respect to ITDR. It states that each IT system must fall under the responsibility of an IT Disaster Recovery Team Leader (ITDRTL) who is responsible for maintaining the ITDR plan.</note>

      <title>Relationship to Business Continuity Planning</title>
      <body>
        <p>ITDR is distinct from Business Continuity planning; specifically it:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>Includes planning for resumption of applications, data, hardware, communications (e.g. IT networks) and other IT infrastructure.</p>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>The Business Continuity Plan (BCP) is broader than the ITDR in that it puts in place a plan for the recovery of an entire business group's business operation in the event of a disaster. The <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/moj"/>'s BCP contains the procedures for building, facilities, transport, people, physical information (e.g. paper) disruption and the communication of critical information to employees.</p>
        <p>Therefore, an ITDR plans is created:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>To aid the business in returning to normal operations as quickly as possible;</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>To ensure the causes of a disastrous event are captured and understood;</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>To help avoid similar incidents in the future; and</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>To aid the improvement of the ITDR policy and planning.</p>

        <p>The ITDR plan sits under an ITSIM plan. It is important to ensure that the steps encapsulated in the ITDR plan align to the ITSIM plan. Further information on the ITSIM plan can be found in <xref href="incident-management-plan-and-process-guide.dita" format="dita">IT Security – Incident Management Plan and Process Guide</xref>.</p>

      <title>Process</title>
      <body>
        <p>The process for developing a good ITDR plan can be summarised into two stages:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>Firstly a "Requirements and Planning" stage establishes the requirements for the plan.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Secondly, during "execution" of the ITDR plan, it is important to ensure that ITDR incidents are managed appropriately, the plan is executed effectively, and that any lessons learned are fed back into the process so that future improvements can be made.</p>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>The following diagram illustrates this process.

    <title>Gathering requirements for ITDR</title>
    <body>
      <p>The ITDR process is based on understanding the Recovery Time and Point Objectives; these form the basic requirements for ITDR. This section outlines the process to identify a Recovery Time Objective (RTO) and Recovery Point Objective (RPO) and the information gathering activities required in order to create an ITDR plan.</p>

        <title>Recovery Time Objective (RTO)</title>
        <body>
          <p>The RTO is the maximum business-tolerable time that an IT system can be unavailable. This time must be considered from the business' point of view where the RTO covers the entire period from initial failover to successful restoration of the business operations. Simply taking this time to recover a single server is not sufficient.</p>

      <topic id="recovery-point-objective-rpo">
        <title>Recovery Point Objective (RPO)</title>
        <body>
          <p>The RPO is the amount of data loss which can be tolerated by the business after a system failover. As such, a business can either re-type or re-generate this amount of information without a significant impact on their business process.</p>

    <title>Writing an ITDR plan</title>
    <body>
      <p>This section provides guidance on writing an ITDR plan with a template provided <xref href="#it-disaster-recovery-plan-template" format="dita">here</xref>. Each sub-section is an element of the ITDR plan.</p>

      <title>IT System Description</title>
      <body>
        <p>For the purposes of the ITDR plan, an IT system is the collection of applications and supporting infrastructure which provides IT services to a <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/moj"/> business group. In turn, this business group supports a number of business processes – it is these processes which must be restored, not just the IT system.</p>
        <p>In order make clear the role of the IT system with relevance to the BCP, this section must clearly list the IT system's constituent components, as well as details of the business processes it supports. This in turn defines the scope of the ITDR plan.</p>

    <topic id="site-list">
      <title>Site List</title>
      <body>
        <p>This section of the ITDR plan must contain details of all the physical sites relevant to the recovery process. It must also include details of any secondary business sites, in case the primary site is affected by a disaster and IT system services need to be made available at a secondary site.</p>

    <topic id="dependencies">
      <title>Dependencies</title>
      <body>
        <p>A list of dependencies (internal and external) must be included in the ITDR plan. Restoration of a business process may be more complex than restoration of a single IT system, and the bottlenecks or miscommunications which can occur here are often the critical points of failure in the process. The impact of the dependency must be captured, in terms of risk, time and cost.</p>
        <p>This information can be used in a disaster event to provide an accurate estimate time for recovery.</p>
      </body>
      <topic id="internal-dependencies">
        <title>Internal Dependencies</title>
        <body>
          <p>Internal dependencies are those which may materialise as part of the recovery actions of the ITDR plan itself, for example:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>When a step in the plan must be completed before a subsequent step can be taken, such as restoring access to a database before conducting login testing.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>If the data centre is in a remote part of the country, and so it may take time for staff to reach the location.</p>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </body>
      </topic>
      <topic id="external-dependencies">
        <title>External Dependencies</title>
        <body>
          <p>External dependencies are those which may affect the success of an ITDR plan and lie beyond the area of control of the ITDR Team Lead (see <xref href="it-disaster-recovery-policy.dita" format="dita">IT Security – IT Disaster Recovery Policy</xref> for a role description).</p>
          <p>For example:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>Where a previous service, such as power, communication or sanitation facilities, must be restored before this system can be restored;</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>Where the recovery of this system must be completed before the Incident Management team can notify staff to return to work at some location.</p>

        <title>Definition of a 'Disaster'</title>
        <body>
          <p>The ITDR plan must include a clear statement on what set of incidents constitute a disaster. Certain components of the IT system may be replaceable without invocation of the entire ITDR plan, whereas an apparently 'small' incident may have a wider reach which does require the plan to be invoked. This section must clarify the situations in which the ITDR plan will be invoked; it may be useful to reference incidents which may have occurred in the past.</p>
          <p><b>Note:</b> This definition must be consistent with corresponding ITSIM plan.</p>

      <topic id="invocation-1">
        <title>Invocation</title>
        <body>
          <p>The ITDR plan does not need to be invoked in its entirety. A disaster event may not require the invocation of all the procedures in the plan, and so the level of response must be assessed and clearly communicated and agreed between the business and IT leads before implementation.</p>
          <p>This section must list those with authority to invoke the ITDR plan.</p>

It is strongly recommended that all previous types of tests are considered and undertaken and reviewed or not taken with formally agreed reasoning to assure confidence before adopting this approach. Care must also be taken to ensure that the live service is not affected during the setup and execution of this test. As with any live service testing, it will be imperative that appropriate service or maintenance windows are identified and agreed with the business, in order to minimise risk to business operations.</entry>

        <body>
          <p>The main objectives of testing an ITDR plan are to determine whether:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>IT services can be recovered after an incident;</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>IT continuity provisions can minimise the impact to the business and their operations, in response to an incident;</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>The ITDR procedures for a return to 'business as usual' operations are validated;</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>Additional factors, such as communication, and incident and alert management are sufficiently robust; and</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>To allow staff to become familiar with the ITDR plan.</p>
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>The test results must show:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>Gaps in the level of service compared to the ITDR requirements (see <xref href="#itdr-requirements" format="dita">here</xref> ).</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>Actions to address these gaps must be identified and assigned to responsible staff.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>A consolidated report for management should be complied, in order to illustrate the results of the tests, along with actions taken to address any issues that arose.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>The process of examining the results against the requirements should identify 'defects' in the Plan documentation and process. These defects must be identified and fed back into the planning documents.</p>

          <p>A test can only be declared a success if the following conditions are met:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>The business processes which are covered by the ITDR plan are proven to be recovered to working use at the end of the test period.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>The entire IT system, including data, can be accessed by users within the period of time specified by the agreed RTO limit (see <xref href="#recovery-time-objective-rto" format="dita">here</xref> ).</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>Where applicable, users can access the IT system from a necessary site after the failover has been tested.</p>

            <li>
              <p>The amount of data loss can be specified exactly, and is within the RPO limit.</p>

          <p>Subsequent review of the test must be undertaken to ensure that all test results are reflected in the ITDR plan. It is recommended that this be undertaken as soon as possible after the test is completed.
It is important that any unexpected results arising from the test, which have not been rectified or are still outstanding issues, are document in the ITDR plan including any actions to rectify any defects or issues.</p>
