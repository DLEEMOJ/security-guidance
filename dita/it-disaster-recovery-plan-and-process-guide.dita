      <title>Business Impact Assessment</title>
      <body>
      <p>The service or system owner should carry out a Business Impact Assessment (BIA) in order to:</p>
      <ul>
      <li>get an overview of the Business as Usual (BAU) functions for the MoJ IT system or service</li>
      <li>get an understanding of the business criticality of the service the MoJ IT system supports</li>
      <li>calculate a Recovery Point Objective (RPO), this is the maximum amount of data the business can afford to lose during a disaster</li>
      <li>calculate a Recovery Time Objective (RTO), this is the amount of time before the disaster begins to seriously impede the flow of normal business operations</li>

      <title>Suggested content</title>
      <body>
      <p>Disaster recovery plans are specific to each individual IT system or service. They are intended to offer guidance to every listed role when responding to an incident.</p>
      <p>When deciding the content of a Disaster Recovery Plan for an MoJ IT system or service, a useful start is to identify every potential disaster that may affect the system or service, together with procedures to resolve each one.</p>
      <p>Each Disaster Recovery Plan should include:</p>
      <ul>
      <li>the point at which the recovery plan should be used</li>
      <li>a clear and detailed process to recover the MoJ IT system to BAU</li>
      <li>a list of key roles and a description of their responsibilities - each role should have at least two sets of contact details</li>
      <li>a list of internal and external stakeholders to be contacted as soon as the incident happens, each stakeholder should have at least two sets of contact details</li>
      <li>a communication list of everyone who needs to be contacted, together with the chains of communication that must be followed</li>
      <li>a list of people who can undertake the role of recovery manager</li>
      <li>a series of steps to follow in order to mitigate the incident</li>
      <li>a list of criteria needed to initiate a forensic investigation, and the role(s) responsible for it</li>
      <li>clear instructions on how to escalate to a higher level of incident response, to include names and contact details and the reason for escalating the incident</li>    
      <li>methods to maintain business continuity whilst the MoJ IT service is unavailable</li>
      <li>a process to identify and capture lessons learned during the incident</li>
      <li>the requirement for a written report for medium and high impact incidents</li>
      </ul>
      <p>All plans should be stored securely both online and offline. Roles and stakeholders mentioned in the plan should know of its location and be able to access it.</p>

      <title>Reviewing and testing</title>
      <body>
      <p>Disaster Recovery Plans must be reviewed regularly, and updated if there have been any changes to systems or services, personnel, or communication chains.</p>
      <p>Plans must be tested and practiced regularly to help familiarise each of the roles with their responsibilities within the response process.</p>
      <p>This is not an exhaustive list. If you need support in creating a plan, please contact the Service Operations Centre (SOC) and the Major Incident Team.</p>
