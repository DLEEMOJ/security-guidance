    <title>Introduction</title>
    <body>
      <p>This document provides the core set of IT security principles and expectations on the handling and classification of information on <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/mojlong"/> IT systems.</p>
      <p>The <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/moj"/> stores and processes a wide variety of information,
        some of which attracts an HMG protective marking or contains personal information.
        The <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/moj"/> has a duty to protect all the information stored and processed on its IT systems.</p>
      <p>This policy outlines the Information Classification and Handling Policy for all information held on <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/moj"/> IT systems.</p>

    <title>Scope</title>
    <body>
      <p>This policy covers all staff (including contractors and agency staff) who use <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/moj"/> IT systems.</p>
      <p>The overarching policy on information classification and handling is
        maintained by <xref href="https://intranet.justice.gov.uk/guidance/security/" format="html" scope="external"><ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/moj"/> Security</xref>.
        This document only contains IT specific policies which are in addition to the overarching policy.</p>
      <p>The overarching policy can be found <xref href="government-classification-scheme.dita" format="dita">here</xref>.</p>
      <p>All Users <b>must be</b> made aware of the Information Classification and Handling Policy,
        and provided with security awareness training which covers this policy.</p>
      <p>All Users <b>must be</b> provided with refresher security awareness training which covers this policy every 12 months.</p>

    <title>Inventory of assets</title>
    <body>
      <p>All information assets need be identified and have a nominated asset owner,
        to help ensure that the appropriate protection of these assets is maintained.</p>
      <p>Examples of what an information asset constitutes are:
      <ul>
        <li>Databases and data files.</li>
        <li>System documentation.</li>
        <li>User manuals, training material, operational or support procedures.</li>
        <li>Security documentation such as RMADS or disaster recovery plans.</li>
        <li>Archived backup data.</li>
      </ul></p>
      <p>The list of information assets and associated Information Assets Owners is coordinated and maintained by individual <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/moj"/> business groups,
        where the responsibility resides with the business group SIRO.</p>
      <p>All <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/moj"/> business groups <b>must maintain</b> a list of information assets,
        their associated named Information Asset Owner (IAO),
        and which IT systems they reside on.
        <note>Some information assets might not be held on IT systems.</note></p>

    <title>Deriving a classification</title>
    <body>
      <p>At the <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/moj"/>,
        all information assets are assessed against HMG guidance on business impact,
        and HMG guidance on the protection of personal data.
        This assessment is used to select the appropriate classification from
        the <xref href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/government-security-classifications" format="html" scope="external">Government Security Classification scheme</xref>.</p>
      <p>All information assets stored or processed on <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/moj"/> IT systems <b>must be</b> assessed for a Business Impact Level,
        where an impact level for the Confidentiality, Integrity and Availability for each asset is derived.</p>
      <p>All Users are responsible for applying the appropriate classification to information assets created or handled on an IT system,
        where a pre-existing classification does not exist.
        <note>As outlined in <xref href="https://intranet.justice.gov.uk/guidance/security/it-computer-security/ict-security-policy-framework/ict-security-policy/" format="html" scope="external"><ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/moj"/> IT Security Policy</xref>,
          each IT system is required to have a Business Impact Assessment (BIA).
          This BIA should be used to record the assessment rational and decision on the impact levels for Confidentiality, Integrity and Availability.</note></p>
      <p id="further-classification-information">Further information on the criteria and derivation for classification can be found at: <xref href="https://intranet.justice.gov.uk/guidance/knowledge-information/protecting-information/classifying-information/" format="htm" scope="external">https://intranet.justice.gov.uk/guidance/knowledge-information/protecting-information/classifying-information/</xref>.</p>

  <title>Application of Government classification</title>
  <body>
  <p>The Government classification scheme defines how information should be labelled and handled.
    Output from IT systems containing information that is classified must carry classification labels where it is <codeph>OFFICIAL</codeph> or higher.
    This includes, but is not limited to, printed reports, removable media, electronic messages (such as e-mail) and file transfers.</p>
  <p>All IT hardware and removable media assets <b>must</b> be labelled with the highest classification
    from among each of the individual information assets stored or processed on it.
    <note>This classification might be reduced if sufficient security controls are applied, for example whole disk encryption, and if there is agreement with the system assurer or <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/cisolong"/>.</note></p>
  <p>All output from an IT system <b>must</b> be given the classification of the highest of each of the individual information assets contained within that output.</p>
  <p>Where applying a classification label is not feasible, an alternative method <b>must be</b> agreed with the system assurer or <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/ciso"/>.</p>
