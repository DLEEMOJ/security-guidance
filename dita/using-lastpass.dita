    <title>What is LastPass?</title>
    <body>
      <p>LastPass is an online password management tool that we make available to you to help you create, store and share passwords. Using it means you no longer need to remember dozens of passwords, just a single primary password. It keeps all your website logins protected, helps with creating new 'strong' passwords and password sharing when required.</p>
      <p>LastPass is available as a browser extension for popular browsers and as well as a full software suite (for use outside of browsers) for Microsoft Windows and Apple macOS.</p>
      <p>LastPass will securely save your credentials in your own LastPass 'Vault' and then offer to autofill those credentials the next time you need them.</p>
      <p>The <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/mojlong"/> has the Enterprise tier of LastPass.</p>

      <title>What it can be used for</title>
      <body>
        <p>LastPass can be used for storing usernames and passwords that are specific to you (for example, your <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/moj"/> Google account details).</p>
        <p>LastPass can also be used for sharing passwords within a team when individual named accounts cannot be created in the service. A good example is running a shared Twitter account.</p>

        <body>
          <p>You could use your <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/moj"/> LastPass account to store personal non-work information but as it is a work account belonging to the <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/moj"/> you may lose access if you change role and will lose access entirely if you leave the <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/moj"/>.</p>
          <p><ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/moj"/> LastPass administrators cannot routinely access the contents of LastPass Vaults but can reset accounts to gain access if there is a good reason to do so.</p>

        <p>LastPass should not be used for storing <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/moj"/> documents - you must use existing <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/moj"/> services such as Office 365 or <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/gsuite"/> for that.</p>
        <p>You shouldn't use LastPass for 'secrets' that belong to systems, only credentials to be used by humans.<ph audience="audience-tech"> There is separate guidance on how to handle <xref href="secrets-management.dita" format="dita" type="topic">secrets</xref>.</ph></p>

          <p>You need to create a primary password - this is the only password you'll need to remember.</p>
          <p>It must be at least 12 characters long (the longer the better).</p>
          <p>You can choose to make it pronounceable and memorable (passphrase) such as <codeph>CyberSecurityRules!</codeph> or <codeph>Sup3rD00p3rc0Mp3X!</codeph>, as long as you're comfortable remembering it and won't need to write it down.</p>

        <p>Like all software, it is important to keep the software up to date (sometimes known as 'patching'). LastPass software generally should self-update to the latest version by itself however make sure you approve or apply any updates if LastPass asks you to.</p>
