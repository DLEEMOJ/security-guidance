  <title>Data Security and Privacy</title>
  <body>
    <p>We believe that our technology must keep data safe and protect user privacy.</p>
    <p>Our digital projects contain important information. Serious data breaches might result if we fail to:
    <ul>
      <li>protect information</li>
      <li>handle it correctly at all times</li>
      <li>dispose of it safely when it is no longer required</li>
    </ul></p>
    <p>Breaches might cause:
    <ul>
      <li>harm to individuals</li>
      <li>financial loss to the <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/mojlong"/></li>
      <li>a loss of confidence in us as an organisation</li>
    </ul></p>
    <p>For personal data, the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and UK Data Protection Act (2018) apply. These make the consequences of data breaches very clear.</p>
    <p>To follow the data regulation/legislation, we <b>must</b> ensure that:
    <ul>
      <li>we protect data to the best of our organisation's capabilities</li>
      <li>we collect data only for described, lawful purposes</li>
      <li>we use data only for the described, lawful purposes</li>
    </ul></p>

    <title>Why are security and privacy important?</title>
    <body>
      <p>Breaches can have an adverse effect the relationship between citizen and government.</p>
      <p>Not only do we have a duty to protect citizens data, but the penalties for violations are also severe. Under the GDPR, serious infringements can result in fines of up to â‚¬20M.</p>
      <p>We must apply appropriate security and privacy protection to all the information we hold and process, at all times.</p>
      <p>We should treat all data as sensitive unless proven otherwise.</p>
      <p>All our work must follow this ethos.</p>

    <title>When this applies</title>
    <body>
      <p>This principle applies to <b>all</b> <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/moj"/> technology projects and business actitivies.</p>
      <p>While GDPR applies only to personal information, all <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/moj"/> projects and tasks must have excellent data security and privacy characteristics. If they handle personal data, they must do so correctly. Projects must follow <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/moj"/> guidelines unless exceptional and approved circumstances apply.</p>
      <p audience="audience-tech">You can design your product to handle personal information correctly. There are a small number of extra steps you will have to take. Remember that personal data includes anything which might identify an individual. Even online identifiers, such as cookies, are personal data.</p>
      <p>The <xref href="https://ico.org.uk" format="html" scope="external">Information Commissioner's Office (ICO)</xref> - the UK's independent regulatory office for data protection - has published <xref href="https://ico.org.uk/media/for-organisations/documents/1554/determining-what-is-personal-data.pdf" format="pdf" scope="external">guidance on how to determine what is personal data</xref>.</p>
      <p>A Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA, formerly commonly known as a Privacy Impact Assessment or PIA) is required for all projects. There are some <xref href="https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/guide-to-data-protection/guide-to-the-general-data-protection-regulation-gdpr/exemptions/" format="html" scope="external">exceptions described by the ICO</xref>.</p>
