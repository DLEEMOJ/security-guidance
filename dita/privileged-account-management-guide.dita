    <title>How to manage privileged accounts</title>
    <body>
      <p>Holders of privileged accounts, such as system administrators, have privileges to perform most or all
of the functions within an IT operating system. Staff should have privileged accounts only when
there is a business need, in order to prevent malicious actors gaining privileged access to <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/mojlong"/>
systems. The <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/moj"/> requires that ownership and use of privileged accounts must be monitored and
audited on a monthly basis.</p>
      <p>Privileged accounts should be protected with the following controls.</p>
