        <p>The ability of the <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/moj"/> to react quickly to IT security incidents will ensure that losses are minimised and the business will be able to resume or continue operations as quickly as possible.</p>
        <p>Incident management is the ability to react to security incidents in a controlled, pre-planned manner. Preparation and planning are key factors to successful incident management and all <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/moj"/> systems will rely upon the development and implementation of an IT Security Incident Management (ITSIM) plan as described in this guide.</p>

    <title>Principles of IT Security Incident Management</title>
    <body>
      <p>ITSIM is a combination of people, plans and predefined processes which enables the <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/moj"/> to deal with the consequences of an IT security incident. ITSIM at the <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/moj"/> follows the following principles:</p>
      <dl>
        <dlentry>
          <dt>Consistency</dt>
          <dd>
            <p>The use of dependable, documented methods ensures that incidents, and the reaction to them, are dealt with systematically and cost-effectively.</p>
          </dd>
        </dlentry>
        <dlentry>
          <dt>Business Continuity</dt>
          <dd>
            <p>It is essential that the business is able to resume or continue operations as soon as possible after a security incident.</p>
          </dd>
        </dlentry>
        <dlentry>
          <dt>Ownership and Responsibility</dt>
          <dd>
            <p>IT security incidents can be very distressing times but reacting on impulse often does more damage than the initial incident itself. The purpose of incident management is to ensure that people with the right level of expertise and experience are consulted and take responsibility for decisions made.</p>
          </dd>
        </dlentry>
        <dlentry>
          <dt>Escalation</dt>
          <dd>
            <p>IT security incidents may require coordination with external agencies such as law enforcement or computer forensic capabilities. Internally, different functions within the <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/moj"/> may need to be involved in incident management. ITSIM ensures that communication channels are predefined and appropriate for the categorisation of an incident.</p>
          </dd>
        </dlentry>
        <dlentry>
          <dt>Preservation of <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/moj"/>'s reputation</dt>
          <dd>
            <p>Information breaches or IT security incidents are extremely sensitive; both politically and how they viewed by the media and public. When major incidents do occur, as well as escalation within <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/moj"/>, there is a public relations requirement to manage how information and questions are dealt with. A good ITSIM should minimise the reputation damage to the <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/moj"/> were an incident to occur.</p>

    <body>
      <p>Incident management requires a variety of decisions to be made, drawing on expertise from a variety of backgrounds, including technical, administrative and managerial depending on the nature of the incident. The incident management process supports the decision making process and subsequent courses of action taken to resolve an incident.</p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>Incident reporting – This is shown as a source of incident information on Figure 3. Generally there are three sources, <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/moj"/> Users reporting incidents using an IT Security Incident Report Form, alerts from other government bodies such as GovCERT and incident detection controls such as an IT supplier reporting the release of an emergency critical patch or an automated alert from an Intrusion Detection System (IDS).</p>

        <li>
          <p>Incident management – This is a function perform by the <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/moj"/> Operational Security Team (OST), it involves conducting an initial assessment of the incident, incident categorisation and management of the incident escalating where appropriate. Note that the process continually examines the categorisation of an incident as it is being investigated. An incident may move up or down the impact scale as more information is discovered.</p>

      <body>
        <p>Security incidents may come to light from a variety of sources, including through active system monitoring and the <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/moj"/> staff reporting suspicious activity or security incidents. All IT security incidents must be reported to the OST, who will conduct an initial assessment and manage the incident through to resolution.</p>
        <p><b>Note</b> – All incidents involving personal data must also be reported to the <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/moj"/> Data Access and Compliance Unit (DACU).</p>
        <p>The <xref href="https://intranet.justice.gov.uk/guidance/security/it-computer-security/ict-security-policy-framework/ict-security-policy/" format="html" scope="external"><ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/moj"/> IT Security Policy</xref> defines the requirements for capturing and recording security events and monitoring them for suspected malicious activity or breaches of security.</p>
        <p>The <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/moj"/> Operational Security Team (OST) is responsible for maintaining a centralised database and view of all IT security incidents across all <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/moj"/> IT systems. This database contains information on:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>Security incident reports;</p>
          </li>

            <p>An up to date status of any actions taken with respect to a particular security incident.</p>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>This database and the effective reporting of security incidents which populate it are important in managing the <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/moj"/>'s overall risk exposure. This is both in the short term, to identify any major deficiencies with an IT system which requires immediate remedial action and in the long term, to capture lessons learnt to improve Information Assurance maturity and the ITSIM plan itself.</p>

    <topic id="categorisation-of-incidents">
      <title>Categorisation of Incidents</title>
      <body>
        <p>Incidents need to be categorised to assess their impact and the required level of escalation and reporting. This is mainly done to manage resources and make investigations cost effective. The initial assessment for all IT security incidents will be made by the OST with support from the ITSO and the relevant system Accreditor as required. The assessment will be in terms of the potential impact of the incident with each incident categorised in terms of Low, Medium or High impact.</p>
        <p>The three sub-sections below provides a description for each category, it is expected that the business group ITSIM plan will contain a tailored version of this description and confirm the escalation route which will be followed.</p>

      <topic id="low-impact-incident">
        <title>Low Impact Incident</title>
        <body>
          <p>These would typically be minor such as low level breaches in security through an accident or carelessness, or a minor loss of service from a service provider e.g. temporary loss of power or connectivity.</p>
          <p>A low impact personal data incident would typically include an incident where no loss has occurred but a weakness in a system may potentially have led to a loss, and with a small amount of remedial action the weakness in a process can easily be addressed.</p>
          <p>Incident categorised as low will be typically managed by the <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/moj"/> OST who will engage with the relevant parties within the business and IT supplier community to resolve the incident. Any escalation (see Figure 4) will be predominantly to the level of the <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/moj"/> ITSO and relevant system Accreditor.</p>

      <title>Investigation and Diagnosis Capability:</title>
      <body>
        <p>The <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/moj"/> Operational Security Team (OST) is responsible for organising the investigation of all IT security incidents. Where there is a need for evidence to be gathered for possible disciplinary or legal proceedings, a forensic investigation may be required. Each impact category should have its own associated management process which consists of the following activities:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>Investigating an incident as directed by the ITSO or SIRO;</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Proactively monitoring any IT system involved in the incident to capture suspicious behaviour;</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Where authorised by the <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/moj"/> SIRO, providing evidence to disciplinary hearings, industrial tribunals, civil courts and criminal courts when required;</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Maintaining files on investigations inappropriate security storage and in accordance to privacy laws;</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Conducting investigations into information security incidents at any of the <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/moj"/> locations;</p>

            <p>Recovering and securely store evidence when required;</p>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>The distinction between the management processes is the priority and level of resources assigned. For example, a low impact incident involving a <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/moj"/> user attempting to access a blocked website will be processed at a slower rate than a high impact incident where a confirm and active network intrusion has been detected.</p>
        <p>It is important to ensure that a diagnosis of the events surrounding each incident is recorded and shared with the relevant stakeholders.</p>
        <p>Where there has been a personal data incident or where possible disciplinary or legal proceedings may be required, the following actions must be taken:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>The relevant <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/moj"/> Senior Manager must collect detailed information on the incident;</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Refer any possible disciplinary action to HR;</p>
          </li>
          <li>

        <p>Based on the investigation and diagnosis of an incident the recovery and closure of the incident can involve many stakeholders. It is important that all stages of resolution are recovers and recorded before an incident is formally closed.</p>
        <p>When an IT system has had a significant compromise, that system may require a review of its accreditation status in light of the circumstances of the incident. This is a decision normally made by the relevant system Accreditor.</p>
