## Storing data on laptops

If you need to store data on your computer you should always remember to move it into:

1.  Your local Electronic Document and Record Management \(EDRM\) system.
2.  An shared drive.
3.  Your -provided 'home' drive.

Do this as soon as you can next connect to the network.

## Where data should be saved when using a laptop

It is best to avoid saving any data on a laptop hard drive. However, if you absolutely must, you should always remember to copy or move the data to the network as soon as you next can connect to it, either via secure remote access or by direct connection.

In order to avoid potential data loss, save data in:

1.  Your local Electronic Document and Record Management \(EDRM\) system.
2.  An shared drive.
3.  Your -provided 'home' drive.

There is a better chance of recovering lost data if you have saved it to the network, as data stored on the network is backed up daily.
