## Christmas SMS delivery scams

A common trick used at seasonal times of the year involves sending fake messages to people about deliveries. The messages are intended to try and capture personal account details. Once captured, this information might also be used by the bad actor to order items, and have them sent to an address that is nothing to do with the account owner.

This leaflet provides hints and tips about best practices to help you avoid getting caught by an SMS delivery scam.

The leaflet is available [here](./culture/christmas-sms-delivery-scams.pdf)
