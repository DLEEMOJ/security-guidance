# Personnel security risk assessment

This guidance applies to all Ministry of Justice \(MoJ\) staff.

There are many aspects of MoJ security, including factors that affect MoJ personnel.

To help identify and implement appropriate personnel security measures, you should first perform a personnel security risk assessment.

This helps you to:

-   Identify and manage risks.
-   Identify effective security measures to address the risks.
-   Make good decisions about the measures to apply.
-   Communicate the information and decisions to MoJ colleagues.

A good starting point for personnel security risk assessment is the UK Centre for the Protection of National Infrastructure \(CPNI\) guide, available [here](https://www.cpni.gov.uk/system/files/documents/46/06/Personnel-security-risk-assessment-a-guide-4th-edition.pdf).
