## Why?

> Have a forensic readiness policy that will maximise the ability to preserve and analyse data generated by an IT system that may be required for legal and management purposes.

## Source

The policy on forensic readiness is covered in the [IT Security â€“ Forensic Readiness Policy](moj-forensic-readiness-policy.md) document, this document sets out the Ministry of Justice \(MoJ\) guidance on implementing that policy and developing a Forensic Readiness Plan.

The document is intended to provide guidance on the development of a Forensic Readiness Plan for MoJ IT Systems, including IT systems hosted by third party suppliers on behalf of the MoJ.
