# Personnel security clearances

Unless otherwise agreed formally by the Ministry of Justice \(MoJ\) in writing, any person \(whether MoJ staff, contractor or through supply chain\) who has access to, or direct control over, MoJ data must have satisfactorily completed the baseline.

The [Baseline Personnel Security Standard \(BPSS\) is published on GOV.UK](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/government-baseline-personnel-security-standard).

## National Security Clearances

The MoJ will advise on a case-by-case basis if an individual requires a [national security vetting and clearance](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/security-vetting-and-clearance#applicant).

The MoJ does **not** have a standing requirement for system administrators or application developers to maintain Security Check \(SC\).
