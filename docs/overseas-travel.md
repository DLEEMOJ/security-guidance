# Overseas travel

**If you are going on a work trip or holiday overseas and you need to take your Ministry of Justice \(MoJ\) IT devices, you must remain vigilant especially when visiting high risk countries.**

As a government worker with access to sensitive information, you are at risk from espionage, intellectual property theft and a range of other threats from hostile third parties as well as foreign intelligence services. These risks can increase when you are overseas, as detailed in the [Overseas Travel Guide](./gs/overseas-travel-guide-v1-2-may-2021.docx).

Before you travel on business, you must seek approval from your Senior Line Manager. You must also inform the security team fifteen days before either a holiday or business trip if you are travelling to or through high-risk countries.

If you are subject to a STRAP briefing you must notify the security team of your intended travel to or through any country \(excluding countries in Western Europe, North America, Australia or New Zealand\).

The [Overseas Travel Guide](./gs/overseas-travel-guide-v1-2-may-2021.docx) provides detailed guidance before you travel.

Mobile roaming should be requested via the [Service-Now IT Catalogue](https://mojprod.service-now.com/moj_sp).
