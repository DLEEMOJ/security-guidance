# System Backup Policy

Backing up is an essential part of protecting Ministry of Justice \(MoJ\) Information and Communication Technology \(ICT or IT\) resources. Backing up provides a means of recovering a system or data to a known state, or point in time. In other words, backups enable you to restore a system or data to be effectively indistinguishable from how it was on a particular date and time.

To help identify formal policy statements, each is prefixed with an identifier of the form: **POL.SBP.xxx**, where **xxx** is a unique ID number.

**Note:** Use of the word **shall** in this document complies with the usage defined in [Government Functional Standard - GovS 007: Security](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/government-functional-standard-govs-007-security).

## System recovery

**POL.SBP.001**: All systems **shall** comply with the [MoJ Security Policy](it-security-policy-overview.md).

**POL.SBP.002**: All IT systems **shall** conform to the [IT Security - System Backup Standard](system-backup-standard.md).

**POL.SBP.003**: All IT systems **shall** be evaluated to determine if a backup schedule is required. This depends on the data stored, and on legal or other regulatory requirements. The evaluation and resulting decision regarding backup requirement **shall** be documented for the system.

The [IT Security - System Backup Standard](system-backup-standard.md) provides details of the tasks, configurations, and processes required for an IT system backup to comply with this policy.

## Technical controls

To address these requirements, these statements from the MoJ [Technical Controls Policy](technical-controls-policy.md) apply:

**POL.TCP.108**: All IT systems **shall** have back-up procedures to maintain the integrity and availability of all Information Assets held. This must align to the Recovery Point Objective which may be expressed in the Business Impact Assessment \(BIA\).

**POL.TCP.109**: All IT systems **shall** maintain a log of all back-ups taken.

**POL.TCP.110**: Back-up data **shall** be stored and handled in a manner appropriate to the protective marking of the Information Assets stored.

**POL.TCP.111**: All IT systems **shall** check all historic back-ups regularly to ensure that they can be relied upon. This includes the testing of back-up media such as tape or hard disks.

**POL.TCP.112**: All IT systems **shall** have a back-up restoration procedure which is tested regularly. Ideally, the testing takes place automatically.

**POL.TCP.113**: The retention period for historic back-ups **shall** align to the retention period of the Information Assets held.
