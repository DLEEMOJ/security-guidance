# System Backup Policy

Backing up is an essential part of protecting Information and Communication Technology \(ICT or IT\) resources. Backing up provides a means of recovering a system or data to a known state, or point in time. In other words, backups enable you to restore a system or data to be effectively indistinguishable from how it was on a particular date and time.

To help identify formal policy statements, each is prefixed with an identifier of the form: **POL.SBP.xxx**, where **xxx** is a unique ID number.

**Note:** Use of the word in this document complies with the usage defined in .

## System recovery

**POL.SBP.001**: All systems comply with the [Security Policy](it-security-policy-overview.md).

**POL.SBP.002**: All IT systems conform to the [IT Security - System Backup Standard](system-backup-standard.md).

**POL.SBP.003**: All IT systems be evaluated to determine if a backup schedule is required. This depends on the data stored, and on legal or other regulatory requirements. The evaluation and resulting decision regarding backup requirement be documented for the system.

The [IT Security - System Backup Standard](system-backup-standard.md) provides details of the tasks, configurations, and processes required for an IT system backup to comply with this policy.

## Technical controls

To address these requirements, these statements from the [Technical Controls Policy](technical-controls-policy.md) apply:

**POL.TCP.108**: All IT systems have back-up procedures to maintain the integrity and availability of all Information Assets held. This must align to the Recovery Point Objective which may be expressed in the Business Impact Assessment \(BIA\).

**POL.TCP.109**: All IT systems maintain a log of all back-ups taken.

**POL.TCP.110**: Back-up data be stored and handled in a manner appropriate to the protective marking of the Information Assets stored.

**POL.TCP.111**: All IT systems check all historic back-ups regularly to ensure that they can be relied upon. This includes the testing of back-up media such as tape or hard disks.

**POL.TCP.112**: All IT systems have a back-up restoration procedure which is tested regularly. Ideally, the testing takes place automatically.

**POL.TCP.113**: The retention period for historic back-ups align to the retention period of the Information Assets held.
