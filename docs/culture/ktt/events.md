## People Manager Security Awareness Training

People managers are invited to attend a new Security Awareness training session.
Thousands of our people moved to remote-working in 2020, significantly changing
our threat landscape, and creating new working conditions (for example working
from home). This 90-minute session will help you get to grips with the main
risks and policies you need to be aware of.

It includes practical advice on how to manage security behaviours in your team.
Some pre-reading and a short post-attendance exercise will be required, in
addition to the workshop. Please sign up via Eventbrite:
