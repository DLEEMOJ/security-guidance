# Coming Back to the Office Securely

**At the MoJ we deliver vital services to some of the most vulnerable people in society, and it's crucial we're able to do so in a safe and secure way.**

When we get security right, we are a well-trusted organisation delivering efficient services. But there are times when things go wrong, and this can cause great harm to our service users, ourselves or to our colleagues. Therefore we all have a responsibility to adopt positive security behaviours.

During the last 18 months, life as we know it changed in more ways than one, especially the way we work. As restrictions begin to end and we prepare to welcome a large number of our people back into the office, the security and privacy team is issuing new guidance to ensure we can come back as safely and securely as possible.

It’s not just working from home or in the office where we need to think about security. If you work whilst travelling there are certain security principles to think about, in order to avoid incidents like [this](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-57624942).

There are three simple reminders for you to check no matter where you’re working - **Overseen**, **Overheard**, and **Overshared**.

## Overseen – Can your screen or work be overseen?

- Always use a privacy screen
- Dispose of all documents securely
- Make sure your screen cannot be seen through a window
- Only conduct video calls from private spaces

## Overheard – Can your conversations be overheard?

- Always use headphones when taking phone or video calls
- Be mindful of your surroundings, and what you are sharing, when talking
- Can you be overheard by anyone outside, in another room, or a shared office?

## Overshared – are you oversharing your work?

- Dispose of sensitive documents appropriately – if you can, shred them at home before disposing, or carefully bring them back to an MoJ office for secure disposal.
- Double check your email – who’s on group email addresses, and what is further down an email chain, before forwarding
- Protect your devices - never share your password, and lock your laptop every time you walk away from it
- Remove your ID badge when leaving an MoJ office – it identifies you as a civil servant (Wear it inside, not outside)

To help you with remembering your security responsibilities, please download this printable [Security Working Checklist](secure-working-checklist.md), and refer to it regularly to prevent a data breach.

## A reminder of why this is important - Case studies...

**Trigger Warning:** The following case studies includes quotes from a domestic violence victim of how she felt following her home address being breached by us. If you believe that reading this will be traumatising for you, for example, if you've had a similar experience, then you may choose to skip it.

Case studies can be [reached from this link](why-is-this-important-case-studies.md).
