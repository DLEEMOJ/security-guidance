# Vulnerability Scanning Guide

**Parent topic:**[Vulnerability Scanning and Patch Management Guide](vulnerability-scanning-and-patch-management-guide.md)

## Introduction

This guide explains the scanning requirements for Ministry of Justice \(MoJ\) systems, including:

-   Point in Time scanning.
-   Web Check.

This guide is a sub-page to the [Vulnerability Scanning and Patch Management Guide](vulnerability-scanning-and-patch-management-guide.md).

## Scanning requirements

The MoJ should conduct the scanning activities outlined below and in line with the requirements identified in this guide.

-   If you are developing a system or application, you must ensure that they are scanned for vulnerabilities prior to live deployment and as part of approval for live deployment.
-   If you are managing a live service, you must ensure that the system or application is scanned at specified intervals after deployment until it is withdrawn from service.
-   The scanning frequency section in this guide gives the minimum scanning requirement, however the system or application itself may need to be scanned more frequently. Any specific scanning frequencies or requirements will be outlined in the system or applications Information Risk Assessment Report \(IRAR\).

## Point in time scanning

Point in time vulnerability scanning provides an assessment of the vulnerabilities at that point in time.

-   Scanning must be conducted through automated vulnerability scanning tools that scan web applications, from inside or outside the system, to look for security vulnerabilities.
-   There are many options for scanning tools including open source or commercially available scanning tools. The Open Web Application Security Project \(OWASP\) provides [analysis](https://owasp.org/www-community/Vulnerability_Scanning_Tools) of each of these tools' strengths and weaknesses.
-   Examples of known vulnerabilities which must be scanned for include cross-site scripting \(XSS\), SQL injection, command injection, path traversal, and insecure server configuration.
-   The top 10 application issues from the [OWASP](https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/) and the CWE/SANS TOP 25 Most Dangerous Software Errors from [SANS](https://www.sans.org/top25-software-errors) are two valuable sources of information about common vulnerabilities which should be scanned for.
-   The scanning process should consider the licensing and support status for an infrastructure device, its operating system, or any applications hosted on the device.
-   Scans which take place one year before the expiry of a license or vendor support should flag the forthcoming expiry as requiring attention and remediation such as license renewal or equipment replacement.
-   If scans identify vulnerabilities, patches must be applied according to the SLAs found in the [Patch Management guide](patch-management-guide.md).

## Web check

The NCSC's Web Check services must be employed for all open internet facing websites operated by the MoJ. Web Check continuously scans these websites and provides regular reports to the Operational Security Team \(OST\). If you are responsible for developing or running a website for the MoJ, you must:

-   Ensure that it is added to the MoJ HQ Web Check Account. [Contact](#contact-details) the MoJ Cybersecurity team to be added to the MoJ Web Check Account.
-   Ensure that any vulnerabilities identified are patched according to the SLA in the [Patch Management guide](patch-management-guide.md).

Further information on the NCSC's Web Check service can be found [here](web-check.md).

## Scanning frequency

Point in time scanning should be undertaken in line with the indicative schedule below for each system and equipment type.

|System and equipment type|Minimum scanning frequency|
|-------------------------|--------------------------|
|Internet Facing Websites|In line with Web Check Guidelines|
|End User Clients|Quarterly|
|Infrastructure Devices|Quarterly|
|Digital Services|Quarterly|
|Server Applications|Quarterly|

The actual minimum scanning frequency for a given service or system may be determined by a separate SLA, contract, IRAR or other formal agreement. If there is a conflict with the Scanning Frequency defined in this guide, the contract, IRAR or other formal agreement takes precedence over this guide.

You need to ensure that scanning logs and results are made available to the MoJ OST/SOC \([OperationalSecurityTeam@justice.gov.uk](mailto:OperationalSecurityTeam@justice.gov.uk)\) for subsequent analysis and potentially forensic investigation purposes.

## Vulnerability alerts

System owners must be notified of any vulnerabilities which are identified through vulnerability scanning. These vulnerability alerts must contain as a minimum:

-   An alert identifier.
-   A cross-reference to known vulnerabilities.
-   A risk rating \(see the [Vulnerability risk ratings](#vulnerability-risk-ratings) section below\).
-   A description of the fix, mitigation, or workaround.
-   A link to patch materials \(if available\).
-   A status which is updated as necessary.
-   Where to get further information.

## Vulnerability risk ratings

Vulnerabilities are designated a severity rating \(1-5\) based on the level of risk they pose to the MoJ. The SLAs defined in the [Patch Management Guide](patch-management-guide.md) for remediation are aligned with the risk exposure the vulnerabilities create to systems. The vulnerability ratings are based on the Common Vulnerability Scoring System \(CVSS\) which is aligned with the Cyber Essentials Scheme. If vendors use different terminology to define Critical or High Risk vulnerabilities, the following table should be used to define the CVSS score of the vulnerability:

|Rating \(Severity\)|Values on CVSS|Definition|
|-------------------|--------------|----------|
|Critical \(4\)|9.0 - 10.0|High, with compounding issues or additional circumstances. An issue that will cause extreme financial or reputational damage, requiring a production system to be taken offline immediately for remediation.|
|High Risk \(3\)|7.0 - 8.9|A serious issue that is likely to cause severe financial or reputational damage and must be remediated promptly within 28 days.|
|Medium \(2\)|4.0-6.9|A significant issue that may cause financial or reputational damage and must be remediated in the next update cycle.|
|Low \(1\)|0.0 - 3.9|An issue that is unlikely to cause financial or reputational damage and may either be remediated in the longer term or given risk acceptance due to mitigating controls.|
|Info|N/A|An issue with no immediate security implications.|

## Roles and responsibilities

### Managed service

If you own a system or a service which is managed by a vendor, or a Managed Service Provider, the vendor may be responsible for scanning and alerting you of any vulnerabilities and providing patches. Please see the [Patch Management Guide](patch-management-guide.md) for more information. The specific responsibilities will depend upon the services provided by the vendor and any contractual agreements between the MoJ and the vendor.

The SLAs for vendors to conduct vulnerability scanning and issue vulnerability alerts to the MoJ are outlined below.

-   Scanning after Scheduled Patch Releases: Scan to take place within two business days from the implementation of the patch as required by the Patching Schedule Service Level Agreement in the [Patch Management Guide](patch-management-guide.md). The MoJ must be alerted of any vulnerabilities within 1 business day of the scan being conducted.
-   Scanning after Ad Hoc / Off Cycle Patch Release: Scan to take place within three business days from the implementation of the patch as required by the Patching Service Level Agreement in the [Patch Management Guide](patch-management-guide.md). The MoJ must be alerted of any vulnerabilities within 1 business day of the scan being conducted.

The actual scanning SLA for a given managed service or system may be determined by a separate SLA, contract, IRAR, or other formal agreement. If there is a conflict with the requirements in this guide, the contract, IRAR or other formal agreement takes precedence over this guide.

### In-house developed

If you are developing or running a system or application in-house, you must make sure that it is scanned. Where centralised scanning is not possible, the system owner is responsible for ensuring that scans are undertaken with at least the frequency defined in this document and in sufficient depth to identify vulnerabilities in libraries, code or infrastructure configuration.

## Vulnerability disclosure policy

If you discover vulnerabilities outside of formal scanning, please read the [Vulnerability Disclosure Policy](vulnerability-disclosure-policy.md) and report the vulnerability within the indicated timescale.
