# Personal Mail and Parcel Delivery Policy

## Audience

This policy complements the Ministry of Justice \(MoJ\)’s overall [security policy](it-security-policy-overview.md).

This Personal Mail and Parcel Delivery Policy applies to all employees, contractors, partners, and service providers, including those on co-located sites and sites owned by other public bodies. This will also include employees of other organisations who are based in, or work at, MoJ occupied premises.

Agencies and Arms Length Bodies \(ALBs\) are expected to comply with this corporate framework, but may establish their own arrangements tailored to operational needs, and should supplement it with local policy or guidance for any business-specific risk.

## Objectives

Following a review by Government Security Advice Centre \(GASC\), the recommendation was that the MoJ implements a policy on personal and business deliveries, including a ban on personal parcel deliveries, to MoJ buildings. This policy introduces a ban on personal parcel deliveries, to comply with HMG minimum physical standard No. 10 on mail and deliveries management.

This policy provides our employees, contractors, partners and other interested parties with a clear policy on mail deliveries, to prevent attack, damage, and interference \(malicious or otherwise\) to MoJ assets, and most importantly physical harm to our people and the public.

## Scope and definition

For the purpose of this policy, personal deliveries are goods purchased over the internet from online retailers, or mail subscriptions that deliver to an office, but without a legitimate business need. This policy still permits vital work-related courier deliveries to reception, as outlined in the policy statements [below](#policy-statements). Vital work-related deliveries are those required to support a business’s function, or to support a business need. Ordering gifts to be delivered for colleagues who are leaving the organisation, or for a special occasion, are not considered valid business-related activities.

## Context

The growth in online shopping has seen an increase in the number of personal parcels delivered to work locations, as a convenient location because of on-site staff on hand to receive deliveries that would otherwise be returned to a depot. However, receiving personal parcels in reception diverts staff from their core duties, and presents a significant vulnerability to the building’s security because the parcel’s contents are unknown by reception staff. Reception areas are generally within the main fabric of a building. They are unlikely to have separate ventilation or enhanced blast resistant walls. This means any hazardous substance or explosive device would have a serious impact throughout the building. The MoJ employs an off-site mail screening company for all mail delivered to 102 Petty France and Clive House, to mitigate against the chances of hostile mail being accepted into the building.

Couriers often require a receiver to sign a Proof of Delivery document, stating that the parcel arrived in good condtion. This risks the department being liable for accepting a package if the contents turn out later to be damaged.

Online retailers recognise the needs of their customers of convenience by offering either “click and collect” options, or offering parcel collection facilities in convenient locations. This alternative to office-based deliveries is both convenient and reduces the need for staff to carry parcels on their commute home.

## Responsibilities

All employees, contractors, partners, service providers and employees of other organisations who are on MoJ premises or co-located sites remain accountable for the security, health and safety of themselves, colleagues, and the protection of Departmental Assets.

## Policy statements

Items required for a legitimate business need can be delivered to an MoJ office, *provided* reception have been notified *by email* at least 48 hours *before* the parcel is to be delivered. The email request **SHOULD** provide the following information:

-   Estimated date of delivery.
-   Name of Courier.
-   Contact details of the recipient\(s\), who can sign and collect the parcel from reception.

MoJ reception will produce a list of scheduled deliveries. Before accepting parcels from the courier, reception will confirm who the parcel is for, and that it was a pre-approved delivery. Failure to follow this procedure might result in the need to have the parcel scanned, or it being treated as suspicious and the “suspicious package process” being adopted.

## Compliance

The level of risk and potential impact to MoJ information, assets, and people will determine the controls to be applied, and the degree of assurance required. The MoJ **MUST** ensure that a baseline of physical security measures are in place at each site, and receive annual assurance that such measures are in place to provide appropriate protection to all occupants and assets, and that these measures can be strengthened when required, for example in response to a security incident or change in the Government Response Level.

The implementation of all security measures **MUST** be able to provide evidence that the selection of measures was been made in accordance with the appropriate information security standards ISO27001/27002, Physical Security advice taken from the Centre for the Protection of National Infrastructure \(CPNI\), and [Government Functional Standard - GovS 007: Security](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/government-functional-standard-govs-007-security).

The constantly changing security landscape has necessarily dictated that Physical Security measures be constantly re-evaluated and tested in order to meet new threats and other emerging vulnerabilities. This policy and subsequent supporting standards will be subject to annual review, or more frequently if warranted.
