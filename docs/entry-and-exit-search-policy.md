# Entry and exit search policy

The Ministry of Justice \(MoJ\) "Entry and Exit Search Policy" applies to all employees, contractors, partners and service providers, including those on co-located sites and sites owned by other public bodies. This also includes employees of other organisations who are based in, or work at, MoJ occupied premises.

Agencies and Arm's Length Bodies \(ALBs\) are expected to comply with this corporate framework, but **MAY** establish their own arrangements tailored to operational needs, and **SHOULD** supplement this framework with local policy or guidance for any business-specific risk.

The policy defines the access controls that are in place when entering and exiting MoJ buildings.

The policy is available for download [here](/gs/MoJ_Entry_and_Exit_Search_Policy_(Redacted).docx).
