# Security breach policy

This document provides an overview of the Ministry of Justice \(MoJ\) Corporate Security Breach Policy, which applies across the entire estate, including the Ministry's agencies and other related offices.

The MoJ takes its responsibilities for security seriously. All MoJ employees, including contractors and agency staff, have a duty to comply with MoJ security policies. These policies exist to:

-   Protect employees, visitors and service users from injury or harm.
-   Protect MoJ assets from loss or damage.
-   Enable the MoJ to maintain business continuity and public confidence.

A security breach is defined as any violation of these responsibilities. This includes a range of behaviour, such as:

-   Failing to wear security access passes in pass controlled buildings.
-   Failing to comply with clear desk policies.
-   Failing to protect sensitive information or assets, and passing on sensitive data to third parties without the proper authority.

**Note:** This list is not comprehensive.

Such behaviour constitutes a form of misconduct that **MAY** then result in disciplinary action being taken against an employee, in accordance with the MoJ Disciplinary Policy. Failure of a contractor to comply **MIGHT** lead to the cancellation of a contract. In certain circumstances, legal action **MIGHT** also be taken.

## Scope

-   Each agency and business area within the MoJ is responsible for developing arrangements for applying the principles of this policy.

## Principles

1.  All employees, including contractors and agency staff, **SHALL** observe security policies. This includes adherence to the requirements of the Official Secrets Act, Civil Service Code of Conduct, MoJ Security and IT policies, and any local or agency level security instructions.
2.  Across the MoJ estate, there **SHALL** be arrangements in place to ensure the effective identification and investigation of security breaches, whether committed by employees or other persons. These **SHALL** be recorded centrally as security incidents to ensure trends are identified, and if necessary analysed to ensure adequacy of controls.
3.  Each organisation across the MoJ estate **SHOULD** publish specific guidance to ensure its managers and all employees clearly understand that a breach of their security responsibilities **SHALL** constitute a form of misconduct. The guidance **SHALL** define whether the breach constitutes a minor, a serious, or a gross misconduct. Managers **SHALL** then decide whether to take disciplinary action according to MoJ \(or HMPPS\) policies, considering the following factors:
    -   The damage or potential damage of the breach.
    -   Any level of intent, including decisions to ignore a problem or issue, or deliberately leak sensitive information.
    -   Whether a previous warning was given to the employee.

## Roles and Responsibilities

Everyone has a role to play in ensuring that we work in a safe and secure environment, and that the data and other sensitive assets we manage are correctly protected. Security procedures apply equally to all who work in the MoJ, including ministers, special advisors, permanent secretaries, judicial officers, contractors, and other staff.

## Security breaches and the discipline policy

The disciplinary policy exists to maintain good working practices and standards of conduct throughout the MoJ. Its principal objective is to encourage improvements in personal conduct rather than to impose penalties on individuals. This policy applies to all employees, although those on probation **SHALL** have disciplinary matters dealt with under the probation policy.

Security breaches resulting from an infringement of the security policy **MAY** lead to the issue of a breach notice. Subject to the circumstances, issuing a breach notice **MIGHT** then initiate the commencement of disciplinary procedures. To assist managers, some examples of security breaches and the level of significance follow. This list is not exhaustive, and is for general guidance only. Each case **SHOULD** be judged according to the level of misconduct, particularly where the behavior is repeated or considered to be deliberate. Advice on when it is appropriate to use the Discipline Policy can be obtained by contacting the [Human Resources Directorate](mailto:Moj-hr-enquiries@gov.sscl.com).

### Minor misconduct

-   Failure of security cleared personnel to inform managers of a change in personal circumstances, for example marriage, change of address, or divorce.

-   Taking IT or communications equipment out of the UK without the appropriate level of authority.
-   Misuse of assets or sensitive information \(see also [Gross Misconduct](#gross-misconduct)\).
-   Failure of security cleared personnel to inform managers of a significant change in personal circumstances, for example civil proceedings, an arrest, or criminal conviction, including an arrest or criminal conviction of a partner or other close relative.

### Gross misconduct
