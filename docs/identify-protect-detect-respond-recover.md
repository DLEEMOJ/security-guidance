# IDENTIFY, PROTECT, DETECT, RESPOND, RECOVER

The Ministry of Justice \(MoJ\) is required to adhere \(but prefers to exceed\) to the [Minimum Cyber Security Standard \(MCSS\)](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/the-minimum-cyber-security-standard).

## The Standard

The [UK HMG Security Policy Framework](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/security-policy-framework) mandates protective security outcomes that the MoJ must achieve \(and suppliers to MoJ, where they process MoJ data/information\).

More information is available from [https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/the-minimum-cyber-security-standard.](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/the-minimum-cyber-security-standard.)

### IDENTIFY

IDENTIFY is a prerequisite standard that requires:

-   appropriate information security governance processes;

-   identification and cataloging of information held/processed; and

-   identification and cataloging of key operational services provided.


### PROTECT

PROTECT is the core standard to provide fundamentally defences to information and requires:

-   access to systems and information to be limited to identified, authenticated and authorised systems/users;

-   systems to be proportionally protected against exploitation of known vulnerabilities; and

-   highly privileged accounts \(such as administrative level\) to be protected from common attacks.


### DETECT

DETECT is the core standard to detect when attacks are taking, or have taken, place and requires:

-   capture event information \(and apply common threat intelligence sources, such as [CiSP](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/cisp)\);

-   based on PROTECT, define and direct monitoring tactics to detect when defence measures seem to have failed;

-   detection of common attack techniques \(such as commonly known applications or tooling\); and

-   implementation of transaction monitoring solutions where systems could be vulnerable to fraud attempts.


### RESPOND

RESPOND is the core standard to define the minimum of how organisations should respond to attacks and requires:

-   development and maintenance of an incident response & management plan \(including reporting, roles and responsibilities\);

-   development and maintenance of communication plans, particularly to relevant supervisory bodies, law enforcement and responsible organisations such as the NCSC;

-   regular testing of the incident response & management plan;

-   assessment and implementation of mitigating measures on discovery of an incident \(successful attack\); and

-   post-incident reviews to ensure feedback into the iteration of the incident response & management plan.


### RECOVER

RECOVER is the core standard to define the minimum of how organisations should recover from an attack once it has been considered closed, and requires:

-   identification and testing of contingency mechanisms to ensure the continuance of critical service delivery;

-   timely restoration of the service to normal operation \(a plan to do so, and testing of that plan\);

-   from DETECT & RESPOND, immediately implementing controls to ensure the same issue cannot arise in the same way again, ensuring systematic vulnerabilities are proportional remediated.
