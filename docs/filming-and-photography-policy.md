# Filming and Photography policy

## Audience

1.  This policy complements the MoJ overall security policy.

2.  This Filming and Photography Policy applies to all employees, contractors, partners and service providers, including those on co-located sites and sites owned by other public bodies. This also includes employees of other organisations who are based in, or work at, MoJ occupied premises.

3.  Agencies and arm's length bodies \(ALBs\) are expected to comply with this corporate framework, but may establish their own arrangements to fit operational needs, and should supplement this material with local policy or guidance for any business-specific risk.


## Objective

1.  This document describes:

    -   The policy on filming and photography on MoJ premises.
    -   Who is permitted to film or take photographs within the MoJ.
    -   The circumstances under which filming or photography activity is permitted.
2.  The policy outlines the requirements that **SHALL** be followed by staff considering this activity, or handling requests from external parties to film or photograph in or near MoJ premises. Before a request from an external party can be considered, the corresponding MoJ sponsor is required to provide an application in writing that **SHALL** be approved by both [MoJ Group Security](mailto:mojgroupsecurity@justice.gov.uk) and Press Office. The latter provides a reputational perspective on the request.

3.  These requirements are designed to protect MoJ staff, and the estate and sensitive government assets from unauthorised access, harm or attack.


## Scope and Definition

1.  This policy outlines the basis for the authorisation of filming and photography on any MoJ premises. The policy does not cover members of the public or media photographing or filming staff outside of MoJ buildings. This policy also extends to any visitors accessing the site, and all Government Departments residing within the MoJ estate.

2.  Where employees, contractors and third-party staff are hosting visitors to MoJ sites, it is their responsibility to ensure visitors comply with this policy.


## Context

1.  This MoJ Filming and Photography Policy aligns to the [Government Functional Standard - GovS 007: Security](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/government-functional-standard-govs-007-security), which states that appropriate physical security measures will be in place to ensure a safe and secure working environment for staff that can protect against a wide range of threats \(including theft, terrorism or espionage\). Specifically, government organisations must have mechanisms to implement internal and external security controls in a layered fashion that detect or prevent unauthorised access, and protect assets, especially those that are critical or sensitive, against forcible or surreptitious attack.

2.  To achieve this outcome, the MoJ **SHALL** put in place arrangements to restrict photography and filming on MoJ premises.


## Responsibilities

All employees, contractors, partners, service providers and employees of other organisations who are on MoJ premises and co-located sites remain accountable for the security, health and safety of themselves, colleagues and the protection of departmental assets.

### Secure use of images and video footage

1.  All photograph or video footage **SHALL** be treated as `OFFICIAL` data and protected in accordance with MoJ [Information Security Policies](https://security-guidance.service.justice.gov.uk/).

2.  The use, retention, and removal of images or video footage that identifies individuals **SHALL** be done in compliance with MoJ [Data Protection Policy and the General Data Protection Regulation](https://intranet.justice.gov.uk/guidance/knowledge-information/protecting-information/privacy-reform/).


### Unmanned Aerial Vehicles and Drones

1.  Unmanned Aerial Vehicles \(UAV\), commonly referred to as 'drones', are aircraft that operate without a pilot on-board.

2.  The availability of UAVs is developing and, in some cases, represent security risks. This is because they can facilitate a wide range of hostile activity, including the unauthorised capturing of images and video footage.

3.  The use of UAVs **SHALL NOT** be permitted on, in, or around MoJ premises, unless express and explicit permission is granted. Any sightings of UAVs on, in, or around MoJ premises **SHALL** be reported immediately to Security Guarding Services. For further information, refer to the MoJ Unmanned Aerial Systems Policy.


## Compliance

1.  The level of risk and potential impact to MoJ assets and - most importantly - physical harm to our people and the public determines the controls to be applied, and the degree of assurance required. The MoJ must ensure a baseline of physical security measures are in place at each site, and receive annual assurance that such measures are in place to provide appropriate protection to all occupants and assets, and that these measures can be strengthened when required, for example in response to a security incident or change in the Government Response Level.

2.  The implementation of all security measures must be able to provide evidence that the selection was been made in accordance with the appropriate information security standards ISO27001/27002, Physical Security advice taken from the Centre for the Protection of National Infrastructure \(CPNI\) and [Government Functional Standard - GovS 007: Security](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/government-functional-standard-govs-007-security).

3.  The constantly changing security landscape has necessarily dictated that Physical Security measures be constantly re-evaluated and tested in order to meet new threats and other emerging vulnerabilities. This policy and subsequent supporting standards are subject to annual review, or more frequently if warranted.
