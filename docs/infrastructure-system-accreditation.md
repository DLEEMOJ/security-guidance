# Infrastructure System Accreditation

## Summary

Accreditation is the formal, independent assessment of an IT system or service against its Information Assurance \(IA\) requirements.

The [Accreditation Framework](https://intranet.justice.gov.uk/documents/2015/04/accreditation-framework.pdf) explains how accreditation forms part of the wider Information Risk Management strategy, is owned by the business owners of the system, and is implemented in a proportionate, pragmatic, and cost-effective manner. The framework includes information about who is involved in accreditation, their roles and responsibilities, and the stages of accreditation and risk assessment.

Accreditation must be considered for any system that handles information relating to business or customers.
