# Government Classification Scheme

The Government Security Classification \(GSC\) system has three levels: `OFFICIAL`, `SECRET`, and `TOP SECRET`.

The GSC was issued by the Cabinet Office in 2018: [https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/government-security-classifications](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/government-security-classifications)

## `OFFICIAL`

This is the majority of information that is created or processed by the public sector.

> Includes routine business operations and services, some of which could have damaging consequences if lost, stolen, or published in the media, but which are not subject to a heightened threat profile.

This classification applies to the vast majority of government information including general administration, public safety, criminal justice, and law enforcement, and reflects the fact that reasonable measures need to be taken to look after it and to comply with relevant legislation such as the Data Protection Act, Freedom of Information Act, and Public Records Acts.

### `OFFICIAL-SENSITIVE`\>

A limited amount of information is particularly sensitive, but still comes within `OFFICIAL` if it is not subject to the threat sources for which `SECRET` is designed, even if its loss or compromise could have severely damaging consequences. The need to know principle **SHALL** be rigorously enforced for this information, particularly where it might be shared outside of a routine or well understood business process. There are very few activities where all related information or cases require the `OFFICIAL-SENSITIVE` marking, though this might apply to assets previously marked as `CONFIDENTIAL`. Across a range of information assets which were previously normally marked as `PROTECT` or `RESTRICTED`, there might be individual cases/instances which are more sensitive \(some of which might be marked `CONFIDENTIAL` on an individual basis\). This more sensitive information is identified by adding '`SENSITIVE`', and must therefore be marked '`OFFICIAL-SENSITIVE`'. This marking alerts users to the enhanced level of risk and that additional controls are required.

## `SECRET`

Very sensitive information that justifies heightened protective measures to defend against determined / highly capability threats.

> Where compromise might seriously damage military capabilities, international relations or the investigation of serious organised crime.

Use of `SECRET` **SHALL** only be used where there is a high impact and a sophisticated / determined threat \(elements of serious and organised crime, and some state actors\):

-   Classified material received from Other Government Departments \(OGDs\)/agencies relating to national security and counter-terrorism.
-   Intelligence and investigations relating to individuals of interests to security agencies.
-   Information that might seriously damage security and intelligence operations.
-   Information affecting the ability to investigate or prosecute serious/organised crime.
-   Personal/case details where there is a specific threat to the life/liberty of an individual such as protected witness scheme records.

The concept of sophisticated or heightened threat doesn't only apply to those with a high technical \(IT\) attack capability, but might apply to criminals who have a developed capability to intimidate or coerce individuals. If disclosure of information might result in serious physical harm or put a life at risk because there is a real and highly capable threat present, the information **SHALL** be tightly controlled. `SECRET` **SHALL NOT** become the default status for material just because of the type of case or potentially severe consequences such as murder trials, or where there is a threat to life. The threat capability **SHALL** also be present.

## `TOP SECRET`

HMG's most sensitive information, requiring the highest levels of protection from the most serious threats.

> Where compromise might cause widespread loss of life or else threaten the security or economic wellbeing of the country or friendly nations.

This classification remains for information of the highest sensitivity relating to national security and subject to highly capable threat sources. There is no change to controls at this level. Any business area holding or expecting to hold information at this level **SHALL** contact the Departmental Security Officer to agree controls.
