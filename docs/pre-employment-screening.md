# Pre-employment screening

Pre-employment screening involves a series of checks to help us make informed decisions about the suitability of individuals to work for the Ministry of Justice \(MoJ\) and its agencies. These checks ensure the following:

-   Compliance with current legislation, for example evidence of Right to Work in the UK
-   That applicants are who they say they are.
-   The integrity of the applicant, our organisation, and the safety of staff and individuals in our care.

Pre-employment screening procedures are required for all people applying for posts or working within the MoJ, including:

-   [Directly employed staff](https://intranet.justice.gov.uk/guidance/hr/recruitment/security-vetting/directly-employed-staff/).
-   [Staff transferring from Other Government Departments \(OGD Transfers\)](https://intranet.justice.gov.uk/guidance/hr/recruitment/ogd-transfers-within-civil-service/).
