# Criminal Justice Secure Mail

The Ministry of Justice \(MoJ\) operates the CJSM service to enable those people working in the Justice system who do not have access to a suitable email service to exchange information in a safer way.

The MoJ does **not** require the use of CJSM where other suitably secure and efficient means can be used. It is considered a safe option to enable communication but it is only an option.

## Getting access to CJSM

To gain access to CJSM, an organisation must have an HMG sponsor, such as the MoJ. This is to confirm the organisation's identity, and that they have active work in relation to the Justice system.

The sponsorship process prevents organisations signing up to the service for non-justice related work. An 'onboarding checklist' helps ensure the relevance of the application to MoJ work.

## Using CJSM

The process for using CJSM to send secure emails depends on how the organisation is set up on the service.

For example, in a 'web mail' configuration, the organisation uses a browser to login to a [web mail account](http://www.cjsm.net/). They can then send and receive emails with a CJSM email address, in much the same way as most web email services work.

## Government secure email policy

Email services that are materially aligned to the [UK government secure email policy](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/securing-government-email) are suitable for the movement of `OFFICIAL` data, including where the `SENSITIVE` handling caveat has been applied.
