# Criminal Justice Secure Mail

The Ministry of Justice \(MoJ\) operates the [CJSM service](https://cjsm.justice.gov.uk/) to enable those people working in the Justice system who do not have access to a suitable email service to exchange information in a safer way.

The MoJ does **not** require the use of CJSM where other suitably secure and efficient means can be used. It is considered a safe option to enable communication but it is only an option.

More information on alternative services is provided in the [Secure Data Transfer](secure-data-transfer-guide.md) guide. Application-specific information is provided in the General App Guidance sections on [Approved tools](general-user-video-and-messaging-apps-guidance.md#approved-tools) and [Tools for sharing information internally and externally](general-user-video-and-messaging-apps-guidance.md#tools-for-sharing-information-internally-and-externally).

## Government secure email policy

Email services that are materially aligned to the [UK government secure email policy](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/securing-government-email) are suitable for the movement of **Official** data, including where the **Sensitive** handling caveat has been applied.
