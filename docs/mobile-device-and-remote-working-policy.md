## Mobile devices

**POL.MOB.001:** When using mobile devices, special care be taken to ensure that business information is not compromised. When issuing or using mobile devices, the following points be adhered to:

### Use in public places

**POL.MOB.006:** Care be taken when using mobile devices in public places, meeting rooms, and other unprotected areas. Protection be in place to avoid the unauthorised access to, or disclosure of, the information stored and processed by these devices.

The [Cryptography](cryptography.md) guide offers techniques and information used in the to support stronger security when using mobile devices.

The [Access Control Guide](access-control-guide.md) explains how the manages access to its IT systems so that users have access to the material they need, in a secure manner.

### Theft or loss

**POL.MOB.007:** Mobile devices be physically protected against theft, especially when left unattended. Examples include leaving devices unattended in cars and other forms of transport, hotel rooms, conference centres, and meeting places.

**Note:** Sometimes, it might feel difficult to determine a sensible level of protection. For example, leaving a laptop unattended but in plain sight on the seat of car in a public car park is not very secure. But if the car is parked in an car park, then the vehicle - and therefore its contents - are probably more secure. The answer is that you should always apply the best possible protection for the assets you are responsible for, at all times. Don't rely on other security mechanisms to provide protection that you neglected to apply.
