# End or change of employment

When somebody joins, moves or leaves the Department, there are certain security procedures that must be followed to ensure a safe environment for us all. The procedures are outlined in the [Joiners, Movers, and Leaver's (JML) process]. (https://intranet.justice.gov.uk/documents/2021/03/joiners-movers-leavers-toolkit.pdf)  

Managers must ensure that all employees, contractors and third-party users return all assets within their possession and that all access rights \(including building passes, access to buildings, IT systems, applications and directories\) are removed at the point of termination or change of employment.

If the leaver has security clearance, managers should contact the Cluster 2 Security Unit via [Security team](mailto:security@justice.gov.uk) to advise that the person has resigned and tell them their leaving date or the date on which they will be moving to a different department.

Leavers should read the HR guidance at [End or change employment](https://intranet.justice.gov.uk/guidance/hr/end-change-of-employment/).

Managers must also [complete a leaver's checklist](https://intranet.justice.gov.uk/documents/2015/04/leavers-checklist-for-managers.docx) as a record of actions.

If you or someone youâ€™re managing wants to change employment within MoJ, there is guidance on [internal moves] (https://intranet.justice.gov.uk/guidance/hr/end-change-of-employment/internal-moves/). For example, detached duty, managed moves and secondment or loan.
