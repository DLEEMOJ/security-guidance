# Secure file transfer

## Introduction

This procedure document assists users who need to share [**Official-Sensitive**](data-handling-and-information-sharing-guide.md#electronic-data-transfer-and-storage) information through a secure encrypted method to partners or external users outside the Ministry of Justice \(MoJ\).

There are several methods [available](general-user-video-and-messaging-apps-guidance.md#tools-for-sharing-information-internally-and-externally) for sending files if the preferred Criminal Justice Secure Exchange \(CJSE\) method is not possible.

**Note:** Regardless of whether the **Official-Sensitive** information is shared with or received from an external party, [out of band checks](glossary.md#out-of-band-checks) **should** be carried out to confirm the legitimacy of the communications and requests.

**Note:** You **shall** comply with MoJ [security policies](cyber-and-technical-security-guidance.md), and refer to guidance on MoJ approved [applications](general-user-video-and-messaging-apps-guidance.md).

## Methods of sharing documents

|Domain|Applications|File size|Internal or external|Examples|
|------|------------|---------|--------------------|--------|
|`*.*@justice.gov.uk`|SharePoint, MS Teams, or OneDrive|Over 25MB|External, including third-party suppliers, legal teams, or other government departments outside of the MoJ.|Multiple files more than 25MB each.|
|`*.*@justice.gov.uk`|Outlook encrypted email|Under 25MB|Internal and external.|Sending a few documents less than 25MB each.|
|`*.*@digital.justice.gov.uk`|Google Workspace|Under 25MB|Internal and external.|Sending a few documents less than 25MB each.|
|`*.*@digital.justice.gov.uk`|Google Drive \(part of Google Workspace\)|Over 25MB|External, including third-party suppliers, legal teams, or other government departments outside of the MoJ.|Multiple files more than 25MB each|

**Note:** The term Google Workspace rather than Google "GSuite" is used now, with Google Drive \(Drive\) included as part of the Google Workspace integrated tools.

**Note:** For further information on the controls in place when sharing sensitive information, refer to the [information sharing](data-handling-and-information-sharing-guide.md#information-sharing) section of the Data Handling and Information Sharing Guide.

## Objectives of this procedure

-   To provide step-by-step instructions on how to transfer files externally.
-   Follow policies and procedures to ensure MoJ information and services are protected.
-   To share information with interested parties on a need-to-know basis only.

## Alternative methods and processes

<a name="criminal-justice-secure-mail-cjsm"></a>

-   **Criminal Justice Secure Mail \(CJSM\)**

    [CJSM](cjsm.md) is the approved secure email solution.

<a name="data-movement-form-dmf"></a>

-   **Data Movement Form \(DMF\)**

    A [DMF](data-handling-and-information-sharing-guide.md#data-movement-form-dmf) is required for all bulk file transfers. All requests **shall** be reviewed and approved by the MoJ [Justice Digital Security Operations Centre \(SOC\)](mailto:security@justice.gov.uk).


**Note:** You **shall not** use personal accounts for work purposes. This includes using personal systems such as Gmail, Hotmail, or Yahoo mail to send or receive emails for work purposes. You **shall** use your officially-issued `*.*@justice.gov.uk` or `*.*@digital.justice.gov.uk` email address for MoJ business.

## Receiving password protected files

It is acceptable to receive password protected files from external parties or from the public. However, you **shall** carry out the following checks:

-   Confirm that the file was received from a known and reputable source or sender. Do this by performing an [out of band check](glossary.md#out-of-band-checks).
-   The password needed to access the file **shall** be shared separately from the file, and **shall not** be provided using the same method as was used to send the file. In other words, if the password protected file is received by email, the password **shall** be received through another method, not by email.
-   The contents of a password protected file cannot always be scanned during entry into MoJ systems. In such cases, the password protected file **shall** go through an isolated local folder or computer disconnected from the network, where it is decrypted and then scanned before progressing further or being uploaded into MoJ systems.

## Sharing files using Microsoft OneDrive or SharePoint

**Note:** A tutorial on Microsoft OneDrive is [available](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/share-onedrive-files-and-folders-9fcc2f7d-de0c-4cec-93b0-a82024800c07). A tutorial on Microsoft SharePoint is also [available](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/share-sharepoint-files-or-folders-1fe37332-0f9a-4719-970e-d2578da4941c).

### Recipient receives an email with a link to the file

1.  Each recipient receives a link to the file within the email. They initiate access by clicking on the **Open** button.

    ![The image shows the email received by the recipient. The email tells them that a file is being shared with them. In addition to the name of the file, there is an 'Open' button for the recipient to access the file.](images/sft008.png)

2.  The recipient also receives a separate email to the same registered email address. This secondary email enables access to the file by providing a PIN Code to open the file.

    ![The image shows the PIN email received by the recipient. The email includes an 'Account Verification Code', which is a multi-digit number.](images/sft009.png)

3.  When the recipient clicks the **Open** button in the 'file share' email, they are asked to provide the account verification code before they can access the file content.

## Sharing Files Using Microsoft Teams

**Note:** A tutorial on Microsoft Teams is [available](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/microsoft-teams-video-training-4f108e54-240b-4351-8084-b1089f0d21d7).

1.  Open MS Teams. Click on the Teams icon within the Left Panel. Click on the icon at the bottom of the app called **Join or Create a Team**.

    ![The image shows the Teams membership panel. The option to join or create a team is selected.](images/sft010.png)

2.  Select the **Create a team** applet, and then click the **Create team** button.

    ![The image shows the 'Create a Team' panel. The panel has a button called 'Create team'.](images/sft011.png)

    ![The image shows the 'What type of team will this be?' panel with several tab options. The tab called 'Private' is highlighted.](images/sft013.png)

5.  You are invited to provide some quick details about the private team. Enter a team name for the **Give your team a name** field. Since the team is not going to be used for a lot of activity, a simple option is to provide a name that includes the current date and time, to make the name unique. For example, you might use a temporary name such as `ProjectAmberFile2022June08`.

    ![The image shows the panel to provide quick details about the private team. The details include two fields: the team name, and its description.](images/sft014.png)

6.  You can either add members to your new team now, or skip the step and do it later.

    ![The image shows the panel to add members to the team. There is a single field, where you can enter a name, a distribution list, or an email enabled security group. When a value is entered into the field, an 'Add' button is enabled.](images/sft015.png)

    **Note:** The team is now available within the left panel. It has a **General** tab by default. Within the right panel, you can either start a conversation in the **General** tab, or click on the **Files** tab on the right to upload content for sharing by the team.

7.  You can add external recipients as members of the team by adding their email addresses using the 'triple dot' menu.

    ![The image shows part of the list of teams. Next to the team name is a 'triple dot' menu. The team name and the menu are highlighted.](images/sft016.png)

8.  A Welcome Message is displayed to confirm the team has been created.

    ![The image shows the 'Welcome to the team' message.](images/sft017.png)

9.  To add members to the team at any time, click the triple dot menu on the channel name and select **Add members**.

    **Note:** External team members - anyone who does not have an MoJ email account - is added to the team as a 'guest'.

    ![The image shows part of the list of teams with the 'triple dot' menu. The menu has been selected, and a sub-menu presented. The sub-menu options include 'Add member', which is highlighted.](images/sft018.png)

    ![The image shows the panel to add a member to the team or channel.](images/sft019.png)

10. You can add members to the team, including external users. Use the **Manage Team** option to review user access, modify permissions, and add files to the team 'file share'.

When a recipient is added to a shared folder, they receive an email inviting them to **Join a Teams Folder**. They should use their email address to log in and access the shared information. The email address is the same one used to receive the invitation.
