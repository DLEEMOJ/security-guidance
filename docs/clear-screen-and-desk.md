# Clear screen and desk

There are many helpful policies and best practices that improve safety and security.

**Note:** In addition to this advice in this document, you should review and follow the guidance in the [remote working](remote-working.md) guidance, for example [thinking before you print](remote-working.md#printing).

## Clear screen

Users comply with the following:

-   equipment be left logged on when unattended. Users ensure that password-protected screensavers are activated when any equipment is left unattended.
-   Computer screens be angled away from the view of unauthorised persons.
-   Computer security locks be set to activate when there is no activity for a short pre-determined period of time. This timeout be set to 5 minutes, by default. The screen lock be manually activated when required.
-   Computer security locks require passwords to be re-entered to reactivate the computer.
-   Desktops and laptops be shutdown if you expect to be away from them for more than half an hour.
-   Users log off or lock their computers when they leave the room.

A best practice is to keep your screen 'desk top' tidy:

-   Avoid leaving files on your desk top where the name might attract attention. For example, having a file on your desk top called `MyPasswords.docx` is a bad idea, for several reasons!
-   Avoid having files or information labelled displayed or stored on your desk top.

## Clear desk

Users comply with the following:

-   Where possible, paper and computer media be stored in suitable locked safes, cabinets or other forms of security furniture when not in use, particularly outside working hours.
-   Where lockable safes, filing cabinets, drawers, cupboards, or similar secure storage areas are not available, doors be locked if rooms are left unattended. At the end of each session all and information be removed from the work place and stored in a locked area.
-   When handling documents security follow the requirements laid down in the [Government Classification Scheme \(GCS\)](information-classification-handling-and-security-guide.md).
-   or information, when printed, be cleared from printers immediately.

[Think before you print](remote-working.md#printing).

It is good practice to lock all rooms and office areas when they are not in use.

Information left on desks is also more likely to be damaged or destroyed in a disaster such as fire or flood.
