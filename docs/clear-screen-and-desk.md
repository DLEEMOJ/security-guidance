# Clear Screen and Desk

## Clear Screen

Users **SHALL** comply with the following:

-   Ministry of Justice \(MoJ\) equipment **SHALL NOT** be left logged on when unattended. Users **SHALL** ensure that password-protected screensavers are activated when any equipment is left unattended.
-   Computer screens **SHALL** be angled away from the view of unauthorised persons.
-   Computer security locks **SHALL** be set to activate when there is no activity for a short pre-determined period of time. This timeout **SHOULD** be set to 5 minutes, by default. The screen lock **CAN** be manually activated when required.
-   Computer security locks **SHALL** require passwords to be re-entered to reactivate the computer.
-   Desktops and laptops **SHOULD** be shutdown if you expect to be away from them for more than half an hour.
-   Users **SHALL** log off or lock their computers when they leave the room.

## Clear Desk

Users **SHALL** comply with the following:

-   Where possible, paper and computer media **SHALL** be stored in suitable locked safes, cabinets or other forms of security furniture when not in use, particularly outside working hours.
-   Where lockable safes, filing cabinets, drawers, cupboards, or similar secure storage areas are not available, doors **SHALL** be locked if rooms are left unattended. At the end of each session all `OFFICIAL` and `OFFICIAL-SENSITIVE` information **SHALL** be removed from the work place and stored in a locked area.
-   When handling `OFFICIAL` documents security **SHALL** follow the requirements laid down in the [Government Classification Scheme \(GCS\)](information-classification-handling-and-security-guide.md).
-   `OFFICIAL` or `OFFICIAL-SENSITIVE` information, when printed, **SHOULD** be cleared from printers immediately.

It is good practice to lock all rooms and office areas when they are not in use.

Information left on desks is also more likely to be damaged or destroyed in a disaster such as fire or flood.
