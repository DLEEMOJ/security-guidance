## Clear screen

Users **SHALL** comply with the following:

-   MoJ equipment **SHALL NOT** be left logged on when unattended. Users **SHALL** ensure that password-protected screensavers are activated when any equipment is left unattended.
-   Computer screens **SHALL** be angled away from the view of unauthorised persons.
-   Computer security locks **SHALL** be set to activate when there is no activity for a short pre-determined period of time. This timeout **SHOULD** be set to 5 minutes, by default. The screen lock **CAN** be manually activated when required.
-   Computer security locks **SHALL** require passwords to be re-entered to reactivate the computer.
-   Desktops and laptops **SHOULD** be shutdown if you expect to be away from them for more than half an hour.
-   Users **SHALL** log off or lock their computers when they leave the room.

A best practice is to keep your screen 'desk top' tidy:

-   Avoid leaving files on your desk top where the name might attract attention. For example, having a file on your desk top called `MyPasswords.docx` is a bad idea, for several reasons!
-   Avoid having files or information labelled `SENSITIVE` displayed or stored on your desk top.

## Clear desk

Users **SHALL** comply with the following:

-   Where possible, paper and computer media **SHALL** be stored in suitable locked safes, cabinets or other forms of security furniture when not in use, particularly outside working hours.
-   Where lockable safes, filing cabinets, drawers, cupboards, or similar secure storage areas are not available, doors **SHALL** be locked if rooms are left unattended. At the end of each session all `OFFICIAL` and `OFFICIAL-SENSITIVE` information **SHALL** be removed from the work place and stored in a locked area.
-   When handling `OFFICIAL` documents security **SHALL** follow the requirements laid down in the [Government Classification Scheme \(GCS\)](information-classification-handling-and-security-guide.md).
-   `OFFICIAL` or `OFFICIAL-SENSITIVE` information, when printed, **SHOULD** be cleared from printers immediately.

[Think before you print](remote-working.md#printing).

It is good practice to lock all rooms and office areas when they are not in use.

Information left on desks is also more likely to be damaged or destroyed in a disaster such as fire or flood.
