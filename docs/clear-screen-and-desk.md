# Clear Screen and Desk

## Clear Screen

Users shall comply with the following:

-   Digital Services equipment shall not be left logged on when unattended. Users shall ensure that password-protected screensavers are activated when any equipment is left unattended.
-   Computer screens shall be angled away from the view of unauthorised persons.
-   Computer security locks shall be set to activate when there is no activity for a short pre-determined period of time \(set to 5 minutes by default\). This can be manually activated when required.
-   Computer security locks shall require passwords to be re-entered to reactivate the computer.
-   Desktops and laptops should be shutdown if you expect to be away from them for more than half an hour.
-   Users shall log off or lock their computers when they leave the room.

## Clear Desk

Users shall comply with the following:

-   Where possible, paper and computer media shall be stored in suitable locked safes, cabinets or other forms of security furniture when not in use, particularly outside working hours.
-   Where lockable safes, filing cabinets, drawers, cupboards etc. are not available, doors must be locked if rooms are left unattended. At the end of each session all `OFFICIAL` and `OFFICIAL-SENSITIVE` information shall be removed from the work place and stored in a locked area.
-   When handling `OFFICIAL` documents security shall follow the requirements laid down in the Government Classification Scheme \(GCS\).
-   `OFFICIAL` or `OFFICIAL-SENSITIVE` information, when printed, should be cleared from printers immediately.

It is good practice to lock all rooms and office areas when they are not in use.

Information left on desks is also more likely to be damaged or destroyed in a disaster such as fire or flood.
