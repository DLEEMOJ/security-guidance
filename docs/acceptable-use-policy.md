# Acceptable Use Policy

This document is the Acceptable Use Policy. It provides the core set of security principles and expectations on the acceptable use of IT systems.

To help identify formal policy statements, each is prefixed with an identifier of the form: **POL.ITAUP.xxx**, where **xxx** is a unique ID number.

**Related information**  


[Technical Controls Policy](technical-controls-policy.md)

## Introduction

IT systems and services are first and foremost provided to support the delivery of the 's business services. To achieve this, most users are provided with an appropriate general purpose computer environment, and access to services and communication tools such as email and the Internet.

This policy outlines the acceptable use of IT systems and services, and the expectations that the has on its staff when accessing or using those systems or services.

## Scope

This policy covers all Users \(including contractors and agency staff\) who use IT systems or services.

Failure to adhere to this policy result in:

-   Suspension of access to IT systems and services.
-   For employees, disciplinary proceedings up to and including dismissal.
-   For others with access to IT systems and services, including specifically contractors and agency staff, termination of contract.

**POL.ITAUP.001**: All Users be made aware of the Acceptable Use Policy \(this document\), and provided with security awareness training which covers this policy.

**POL.ITAUP.002**: All Users undergo refresher security awareness training covering this policy, every 12 months.

## Protection of assets

It is paramount that all Users protect the confidentiality of information held on, processed, and transmitted by IT systems. All Users have a role in protecting the information assets which are under their control, or that they have access to.

IT systems have been designed to protect the confidentiality of the data held on them. However, maintaining this requires the application of, and adherence to, a clear set of operating procedures by all Users. These are collectively known as Security Operating Procedures \(SyOPs\).

It is important that all Users of an IT system, including support and system administrative Users, are familiar with these SyOPs, and are provided with the appropriate training.

**POL.ITAUP.003**: All IT systems have, and maintain, a set of Security Operating Procedures \(SyOPs\). For systems undergoing an assurance process, these SyOPs be included as part of the assurance.

**POL.ITAUP.004**: All Users of an IT system, including support and system administrative staff, read the applicable SyOPs, and acknowledge that they have both read and understood the SyOPs before being granted access. A record be kept of a User being granted access, and made available for review during assurance, or upon authorised request.

**POL.ITAUP.005**: All Users be made aware that non-conformance to the system SyOPs constitutes a breach of the [IT Security Policy](it-security-policy-overview.md), and result in disciplinary action.

**POL.ITAUP.006**: Any change to an IT system's SyOPs be approved through an assured change control process, before the change is made.

**POL.ITAUP.007**: Any request to perform an action on an IT system which contravenes its SyOPs be approved by the before the action is taken.

For most Users, access to IT systems and information held on them is through a desktop device, a laptop, or a mobile or remote device. These devices have the capacity to store large amounts of potentially sensitive information assets. It is important that Users follow Information Management processes and handling guidelines to ensure information is stored and accessed appropriately. Further information on information handling is provided in the [Information Classification and Handling Policy](information-classification-and-handling-policy.md).

### General Security Operating Procedures \(SyOPs\)

The policy refers to a key set of general SyOPs, as follows:

-   [Privileged User Guide](privileged-user-guide.md).
-   [System Users and Application Administrators](system-users-and-application-administrators.md).
-   [Remote Working](remote-working.md).

To minimise the number of SyOPs in circulation and standardise procedures, the SyOPs listed previously act as the primary set, which individual IT systems are expected to conform to, in terms of their own SyOPs. Any deviations or additions are dependent upon approval through the assurance process.

**POL.ITAUP.008**: All IT systems have documented SyOPs which comply with the general SyOPs [listed in this policy](#general-security-operating-procedures-syops). Any deviations or additions be recorded in separate SyOPs which form an addendum to one of the SyOPs [listed](#general-security-operating-procedures-syops).

**Note:** An IT system make use of, in their entirety, one or more of the SyOPs listed in this policy if the procedures of that IT system do not deviate from those described in the general SyOPs.

### Removable Media

Removable storage media include devices such as USB memory sticks, writeable CDs or DVDs, and external drives. These devices contain large amounts of protectively marked data, and so pose a significant risk to the confidentiality of the data they hold. As such, the controls the use of removable media through SyOPs, technical security controls, and by requiring movements of bulk data to be authorised by using a [Data Movement Form](data-handling-and-information-sharing-guide.md).

**POL.ITAUP.009**: Any removable media device be approved by security, where that device is used to store protectively marked data. The type of device and associated SyOPs be approved by security before operational use.

**POL.ITAUP.010**: All Users ensure that all data stored on or transported by removable media is in accordance with the applicable system SyOPs.

**POL.ITAUP.011**: All Users seek approval from the prior to any bulk transfer of protectively marked data using removable media. security advises on any technical and procedural requirements, such as data encryption and handling arrangements.

### Passwords

A username and password combination is the primary access credential used for authenticating a User to systems, and authorising User access to information assets and services provided by that system. It is therefore important that Users keep their access credentials safe and secure.

**POL.ITAUP.012**: All Users share or disclose any passwords with any other person.

**POL.ITAUP.013**: All Users :

-   Attempt to gain unauthorised access to another User's IT account.
-   Attempt to use another Users access credentials to gain access to an system.
-   Attempt to access information for which they do not have a 'need-to-know'.
-   Use the same password on more than one system.

## Legal and regulatory requirements

There are a number of legal and regulatory requirements that the must comply with. These obligations are in addition to HMG security policy, as expressed in the [HMG Security Policy Framework](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/security-policy-framework).

**POL.ITAUP.014**: All Users be made aware of legal and regulatory requirements that they adhere to when accessing systems. These requirements be included as part of the SyOPs.

## Corporate Image

Communications sent from systems, or products developed using them, such as branded documents or presentations, damage the public image of the if they are for purposes not in the interest of the , or they are abusive, offensive, defamatory, obscene, or indecent, or of such a nature as to bring the or any its employees into disrepute.

**POL.ITAUP.015**: All Users ensure that systems are not used in an abusive, offensive, defamatory, obscene, or indecent way, or are of such a nature as to bring the or any its employees into disrepute.

## Potential to cause offence and harm

The has a duty of care to all staff, and to provide a positive working environment. Part of this duty involves ensuring all staff maintain a high standard of behaviour and conduct.

**POL.ITAUP.016**: systems be used for any activity that causes offence to employees, customers, suppliers, partners, or visitors, or used in a way that violates the [Code of Conduct](https://intranet.justice.gov.uk/guidance/hr/conduct-behaviour/).

## Personal use

The permits limited personal use of its IT systems, provided this use does not conflict or interfere with normal business activities. The monitors the use of its IT systems. Any personal use is subject to [monitoring and auditing](#monitoring-of-communications), and also be retained in backup format, even after deletion from live systems.

The reserves the right to restrict personal use of its IT systems. The main methods employed are:

-   Filtering of Internet and email traffic. All Internet and email traffic is filtered and analysed. Further details are [available](#electronic-messaging-and-use-of-the-internet).
-   Policy and procedures. This policy and associated SyOPs set out the restrictions placed on the use of systems.

**POL.ITAUP.017**: Users ensure that any personal use of systems does not conflict or interfere with normal business activities. Any conflict be reported to the User's line manager.

**POL.ITAUP.018**: Users ensure that any personal use of systems is consistent with any applicable SyOPs, and with this acceptable use policy.

**POL.ITAUP.019**: Users be aware that any personal use of systems which contravenes any applicable SyOPs, or this acceptable use policy, constitutes a breach of the [IT Security Policy](it-security-policy-overview.md) and result in disciplinary action.

## Maintaining system and data integrity

Users comply with all applicable operating procedures, and ensure that they do not circumvent any security controls in place. Changes to the configuration of an IT system which affect either the integrity of that system or the integrity of shared data be undertaken or supervised by an authorised User or system Administrator.

**POL.ITAUP.020**: All Users request any changes to systems or equipment through the . Further details are provided in the [System Users and Application Administrators](system-users-and-application-administrators.md) guidance.

## Electronic messaging and use of the Internet

Due to the risks associated with electronic communications such as email and the Internet, the controls and monitors usage of systems in accordance with applicable legal and regulatory requirements.

IT systems are designed to protect the from Internet-borne attacks, to reduce the risk of information being leaked or compromised, and to support the in providing a safe working environment. This is mainly achieved through the filtering and monitoring of all Internet and email traffic.

Also, the use of any high bandwidth services, such as video streaming websites, create network capacity issues, causing poor performance affecting important services. Therefore, the restricts access to the Internet, based on job role. Amendments can be made on the submissions of a business case for approval by the .

The regards as a disciplinary offence any usage of electric communications, such as email and other methods including instant messaging and the Internet, which breaks the law, contravenes HR policies, or involves unauthorised access to or handling of material that is deemed to be inappropriate, abusive, offensive, defamatory, obscene, or indecent.

External email and the Internet are, in general, insecure services where it is possible for external entities to intercept, monitor, change, 'spoof', or otherwise interfere with legitimate content. The deploys a number of security controls to protect its Users from Internet- and email-borne attacks. However, these controls are reliant on Users remaining vigilant, following any applicable SyOPs, and [reporting](reporting-an-incident.md) any suspicious behaviour.

**POL.ITAUP.021**: All Users use the Internet, email, and other electronic communication systems only in accordance with this acceptable use policy document.

### Managing email use

Users are responsible for ensuring that all information is handled in line with the protective marking of that information, in accordance with the [Information Classification and Handling Policy](information-classification-and-handling-policy.md).

The is connected to the Government network, which provides a secure environment for sending or receiving emails between Government departments. This allows Users with an email account \(normally with the suffix '`@justice.gov.uk`'\) to send emails with [handling caveats](government-classification-scheme.md) such as to another or government User, where their email suffix ends in '`gov.uk`'.

**POL.ITAUP.022**: All Users ensure that information contained within or attached to an email is handled in accordance with the [Information Classification and Handling Policy](information-classification-and-handling-policy.md).

Email is a major source of malware, and a route into the for criminal organisations. It be used to defraud staff, or to exfiltrate information. All Users exercise care when handling emails, and [report any suspicious activity as an IT security incident](reporting-an-incident.md).

**POL.ITAUP.023**: All Users ensure that they do not:

-   Open any attachments to an email where the source is untrusted, unknown, or unsolicited.
-   Click on any links within an email, where the source is untrusted, unknown, or unsolicited.

**POL.ITAUP.024**: Where a User suspects that an email received is from an untrusted, unknown, or unsolicited source, they [report it as an IT security incident](reporting-an-incident.md).

## Connectivity and remote access

Remote access is provided to systems and services, allowing Users access from offsite and home locations to connect in. The main methods of access are either via a laptop or other mobile device. Normally, remote access is to a protected IT system. Users be aware of the security controls and procedures of the devices and systems being used, as well as any applicable general physical security considerations. This includes any restriction on the carriage of such devices, as they contain HMG protectively marked data, or HMG cryptographic material.

security maintains a list of countries where carriage and use of remote access devices is permitted.

Further details can be found in the [Remote Working](remote-working.md) guidance.

**POL.ITAUP.025**: All Users be aware of the [Remote Working](remote-working.md) guidance, and confirm that they have read and understood it before being provided with any remote access devices or equipment, such as an encryption or access control token.

**POL.ITAUP.026**: Any User wishing to take a remote access device out of the UK consult the [Remote Working](remote-working.md) guidance before doing so, and the applicable device IT Security Operating Procedures document.

## Monitoring of communications

Communications be monitored without notice, and on a continual basis, for a number of reasons. These include compliance with legal obligations, effective maintenance of IT systems, preventing or detecting unauthorised use or criminal activities such as cyber-intrusion, monitoring of service or performance standards, providing evidence of business transactions, and checking adherence to policies, procedures, and contracts.

The monitors telephone usage, network, email, and Internet traffic data, including sender, receiver, subject, attachments to an email, numbers called, duration of calls, the domain names of websites visited, the duration of visits, and files uploaded or downloaded from the Internet, at a network level.

The , so far as possible and appropriate, respects User privacy and autonomy whilst they are working, but in accordance with the [personal use information](#personal-use), any personal use of systems is also subject to monitoring. By carrying out personal activities using systems, Users are consenting to the processing any sensitive personal data which be revealed by such monitoring, such as regular visits to a set of websites.

For the purposes of business continuity, it be necessary for the to access business communications, including within email mailboxes, while a User is absent from work, including for a holiday and because of illness. Access is only granted through submission of a formal request to the , where approval is required from the relevant line manager. The and HR are normally consulted as well, before access is granted.

**POL.ITAUP.027**: All Users be aware that their electronic communications are being monitored in accordance with this acceptable use policy.

**POL.ITAUP.028**: All Users be aware that business communication such as email mailboxes be accessed if they are absent from work. This access is normally requested through, and authorised by, the User's line manager. The and HR are normally consulted as well, before access is granted.

## Data protection considerations

Acceptable use considerations apply to the storage of personal data. This storage includes data hosting in 'cloud' environments, or within services or databases hosted or administered outside:

-   The UK.
-   The European Economic Area \(EEA\).
-   Countries with an [Adequacy Decision](https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/dp-at-the-end-of-the-transition-period/data-protection-and-the-eu-in-detail/adequacy/) \(an 'Adequacy Decision Country' or ADC\).

**POL.ITAUP.029**: The default position is that personal data be transferred to or through, or stored, in the US or elsewhere outside the UK, EEA, or an ADC, other than in exceptional circumstances.

This position also applies where a supplier uses cloud storage facilities in the UK, EEA, or an ADC, but their employees outside the UK, EEA, or the ADC are able to view the information for activities such as maintenance or trouble-shooting. The effect of this access is equivalent to the personal data being held outside the UK, EEA, or an ADC.

The reason for this position is that even with additional contractual clauses, the cannot ensure protection of its personal data stored outside the UK, EEA, or an ADC, due to some government surveillance laws.

**POL.ITAUP.030**: A supplier based in the UK, EEA, or an ADC, and which stores client data in the UK, EEA, or an ADC, be considered first and preferred where possible.

**POL.ITAUP.031**: If an alternative supplier cannot be sourced, then a Standard Contractual Clause \(SCC\) and a Transfer Impact Assessment \(TIA\) be completed.

These documents are reviewed by the , after which the transfer be approved. A template for these documents can be requested from

**POL.ITAUP.032**: If the outcome of the assessment does not support the transfer and storage of information outside the UK, EEA, or an ADC, the Information Security and Risk \(ISR\) Board review the case, and if appropriate, accept the risks in order for the supplier to be used.

**POL.ITAUP.033**: This acceptable use policy for personal data apply to:

-   An existing supplier changing the location of its servers, storage, or services outside the UK, EEA, or an ADC.
-   New suppliers.
