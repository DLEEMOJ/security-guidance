# Roles and responsibilities for handling security and privacy incidents

When a security or privacy incident occurs, we quickly create a virtual team using the roles described below. These are not new posts, but roles that suitably trained individuals will assume during an incident.

This team is responsible for the operational response to the incident. If the severity or complexity of the incident warrants it, the incident manager can trigger the Ministry of Justice \(MoJ\)'s gold-silver-bronze operational response processes; beginning with a silver command to coordinate cross-department response, or cross-incident response if multiple incidents are occurring that may be related.

The data incident team - the team responsible for resolving an incident - will comprise of the following roles

**Parent topic:**[Security Incident Management Plan](security-incident-management-plan.md)

## Incident Manager

The person who assumes command of a major data incident when it begins, and drives it to resolution. They collect information from incident team members, ensure everyone is communicating, decide on the correct steps to take, and then delegate these steps to resolvers - they do not 'do'. They are the single authority on what is happening during a major incident.

Post-incident the incident manager captures lessons learned, and takes the lead on ensuring preventative steps are taken for the future.

### What does the Incident Manager do?

-   You explain in all calls that you are the current incident manager, and who is the deputy and secretariat.

-   You identity what is known, unknown, and suspected about the incident, and delegate to subject matter experts to gather data to confirm / refute suspicions You identify and delegate actions to subject matter experts and/or suppliers to mitigate and resolve the incident. Importantly, you do not do these actions - you delegate.

-   You work with your deputy to decide whether to escalate, and whether other comms are required.

-   \(if the incident is continuing in 'hot' mode when you are going offline then you brief the next incident manager\)

-   You manage your span of control - if the incident is getting too complicated, or too widespread an impact, you escalate and split off sub-teams to handle aspects of the incident.

-   You decide when the incident is resolved, and close it.

-   You ensure that post-incident activities are conducted to ensure lessons are learned.


## Deputy Incident Manager

Direct support for an incident manager. Helps coordinate activities, and is ready to step into the role of incident manager should the manager be unavailable \(e.g. illness, or needed to act as a resolver\).

### What does the Deputy Incident Manager do?

-   You are there to support the Incident Manager however you can.

-   You must monitor the status of the incident and suggest escalation as necessary

-   You should keep track of time and responses from those involved in the incident to help keep things moving.


## Secretariat

Keeps a full contemporaneous log of activities undertaken during the incident to ensure all important decisions are captured for later review \(and to help others get up to speed quickly\).

### What does the Secretariat do?

-   Your role is to keep an excellent contemporaneous log of what has occurred.

-   You help the Incident Manager and Deputy keep the Incident Management Tea coherent as to what is happening.

-   You establish the communication lines necessary for the incident, including at least a dedicated private slack channel for the incident with the Incident Management Team on it, and establish regular video calls as per the incident manager's instructions.

-   You should ensure everyone is aware of their actions and that all actions have owners and times they will be reported on.

-   You should ensure that post-incident all documentation is captured and recorded properly.


## Subject Matter Expert\(s\)

A Subject Matter Expert, or SME, is a domain expert who can take actions to rapidly fix issues that may be causing a data breach, provide additional context on the event\(s\) occurring, and to clearly communicate their knowledge to the incident management group. If this is a security incident then a security analyst must be included; if this is an incident that may involve personal data then a member of the data privacy team must be included.

### What do SMEs do?

-   Your role is to investigate the incident and perform remedial steps as instructed by the Incident Manager

-   You always make recommendations as to what to do to the group before doing them.


## Communications Lead

This individual is responsible for interacting with users - internal or external - as well as any third parties that need to be involved in the incident. They need not do the communication directly, but they are responsible for managing the communications around the incident effectively, and ensuring the appropriate channels and points-of-contact are used to relay messages.

### What does the Communications Lead do?

-   You are on standby to pass appropriate messages from the Incident Management Team to those who need to be informed about the incident.

-   You are responsible for ensuring accurate and timely sharing of information about the incident in agreement with the incident manager.


## Liaison\(s\)

One or more liaison staff are responsible for interacting with internal stakeholders - specialist suppliers, service teams, etc, - and also getting other areas of the organisation involved as a specific incident requires \(such as involving SOCT or legal for example\).

### What does the Liaison do?

-   You are responsible for contacting relevant internal specialists individuals and teams, and suppliers / partners as necessary and agreed with the incident manager to bring them into the incident, or to seek their advice as required.

-   You notify internal stakeholders who need to be given a dedicated briefing on the incident - working with the communications lead to achieve this \(such as senior security leadership, SIROs etc\).
