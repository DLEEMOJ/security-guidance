# IT Health Check - Test cancellations and delays

Once IT Health Check \(ITHC\) execution dates are agreed, it is expected that all parties have:

-   A baselined scope.
-   A delivery timeline.
-   Finalised resource plans.

In addition, any ITHC risks, issues, and dependencies are known and action plans in place.

It is understood, however, that on occasion, even the best laid plans are challenged when unknown and last-minute issues arise.

In these scenarios, it is important and recommended that all parties collaborate to discuss the potential impact to the ITHC, and work together to resolve or reduce the impact.

Project teams should be aware that, if the issue originates from within the project and that ITHC dates are impacted, then delay or cancellation charges apply and are cross-charged back to the project team.

For guidance purposes, indicative information is provided in the following tables.

## External Vendor test team delay / cancellation charge table

|Days before test start|Charge|Cross charge|
|----------------------|------|------------|
|30|50% of total testing cost scheduled|£900/resource/day|
|14|100% of total testing cost scheduled|£900/resource/day|

## Internal Security test team delay / cancellation charge table

|Days before test start|Event|Charge|Cross charge|
|----------------------|-----|------|------------|
|7|Test delayed by &gt; 2 days|50% of total testing cost scheduled|£600 rate per person day of overall test resourcing|
|7|Test delayed by &lt; 2 days|50% of testing cost scheduled for the 2 days scheduled|2 x num testers x £600|
|3|Testing delayed or cancelled|75% of testing cost scheduled|Num testers x days x £600|
|7|Test cancelled|40% of total testing cost scheduled|Total test person days scheduled x £600 x 40%|
