# Security Guidance for Using a Personal Device

## Summary

Not everyone has access to an Ministry of Justice \(MoJ\) device which can be used remotely. In these extraordinary times, exceptional provision is being developed for you to use your own devices for work purposes.

Until that provision is in place, you must not use a personal device for work purposes.

## Guidance

-   If you have an MoJ-issued device, you must use that.

-   You may not use Office 365 tools \(email, calendar, Word, Excel, Powerpoint, etc.\) for work purposes on a personal device \(desktop, laptop, tablet or phone\). This applies to web browser and installed client applications.

-   Do not send MoJ information to your personal email account, or use personal accounts for work purposes.

-   Do not store work files or information on a personal device \(desktop, laptop, tablet or phone\).

-   Some teams within the MoJ, such as groups within Digital & Technology, and HMCTS, might already have prior permission to use personal devices for aspects of software and service development work. This permission continues, but is being reviewed on an on-going basis.


This guidance applies to all staff and contractors who work for the MoJ. It provides advice about using your personal devices for work purposes.

***Note**: You are not being asked or required to use your own devices for work purposes. If you have access to MoJ devices for work purposes, you should use them by default.*
