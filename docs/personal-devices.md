## Overview

A personal device is any desktop, laptop, tablet, phone, external drive, or similar device that the does not own.

**Note:** 'Personal devices' include all personally-owned devices with processing ability or Internet connectivity. This includes all types of assistance, organisational or Internet of Things \(IoT\) devices. Connected vehicles are a special case [discussed in this guidance](#connected-vehicles). In case of any doubt, [ask for help](#contact-details) about specific examples.

Not everyone has access to an device for remote use. If you need equipment, you can request it. It can be provided quickly. Contact your Line Manager for details. A request can then be raised through the .

In unusual circumstances, it might not be possible to organise provision of equipment. In such cases, you request access to an [virtual environment](#virtual-environment).

Except when connecting to an [virtual environment](#virtual-environment), or with documented approval in exceptional circumstances as described [in this guidance](#guidance), you use a personal device for work purposes.

Avoid connecting peripherals to devices, unless those peripherals are supplied or approved by the . Examples of peripheral devices include USB, wireless, or [Bluetooth](bluetooth.md) keyboards or mice.

**Note:** Exemptions are possible for connecting peripherals where [accessibility support](bluetooth.md#accessibility) is required. Contact your Line Manager for documented approval before connecting a peripheral device.

Personal devices be charged from the USB ports of an device.

**Note:** Specifically: a personal mobile phone be charged from the USB ports of an device.

## Guidance

-   If you have an -issued device or virtual environment, you use that.
-   You use a personal device to access tools such as Gmail, Docs, Slides, Sheets, Drive, Meet, or Hangouts for work purposes.
-   You use a personal device to access Office 365 tools such as Outlook email or calendar, Word, Excel, or PowerPoint for work purposes.
    -   Wherever possible, an work device be used to join business Teams calls, either via video or dial in.
    -   In cases where staff have not been provided with a work phone or laptop or any other work device which allows them to join or dial into Teams, staff join from their personal devices as a Guest. The chair of the meeting confirm the identity of each and every person joining their call as a Guest.
-   This guidance applies to all tools accessed through a web browser or installed client applications.
-   You send information to your personal email account.
-   You use personal accounts for work purposes.
-   You store work files or information on a personal device such as a desktop, laptop, tablet or phone.
-   You store work files or information on a personal storage device or memory stick, such as an external drive, thumb drive, or USB stick.
-   Some teams within the have permission to use personal devices for some tasks. This permission continues, but is being reviewed on an on-going basis. Ensure that you have documented approval recording your permission. Ensure that the permission is no more than 12 months old. To request or refresh permission, ask your Line Manager to seek approval by checking with the .

**Note:** You are not asked or required to use your own devices for work purposes. Statement **POL.MOB.009** of the [mobile device and remote working policy](mobile-device-and-remote-working-policy.md#use-of-private-equipment) makes clear that you use personal devices for work purposes. If you have access to devices for work purposes, you use them by default. A special case is that if you do not have an -issued mobile phone, you use a personal device to receive [Multi-factor authentication \(MFA\)](glossary.md#multi-factor-authentication-mfa) codes or messages which authorise access by devices to systems.

## Using tools on personal devices

In accordance with other policy on the use of personal devices, and the use of mobile devices specifically, you use personal devices to access tools, such as Slack workspaces.

**Note:** The rest of this section refers to Slack workspaces, but applies equally to other tools, such as Teams, Trello, Jira, and so on.

You could of course use personal devices to access other \(non-\) Slack communities.

The point is that you use personal devices for work purposes. Slack workspaces are official workspaces and only be accessed using devices.

Personal devices are not allowed to access services or content containing data. Work devices be used to access services such as Slack communities. If you do not have a work mobile device, and need to access services such as Slack on a mobile device, you request one using [Service Now](https://mojprod.service-now.com/moj_sp/?id=home).

## Virtual environment

The provides access to a Virtual Environment to help with exceptional circumstances. This is where suitable provision of a physical device is not possible.

Request a virtual environment through the `Creation of WVD instances` product offering within the Service Catalogue in Service Now.

**Note:** A virtual environment does not offer the same capabilities or performance as a physical -issued device. Using an -issued device is always preferable.

## Connected vehicles

Connected vehicles are effectively Bluetooth-connected storage devices. They are considered personal devices for the purposes of this guidance, regardless of whether they are owned, leased or rented.

Automatic transfer of contact information and calendar events might happen during the pairing process. The resulting transferred data is accessible to any third party who subsequently pairs their mobile device to the vehicle.

Additionally, although such platforms usually offer an option to delete paired profiles, there is currently no confirmation that the data is actually erased to a satisfactory level. Transferred information might not be immediately visible or accessible, but this is not the same as deleting the information from the vehicle.

For these reasons, devices be paired with Bluetooth-enabled vehicles.
