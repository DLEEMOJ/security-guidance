    Information used to prove someone's identity, to confirm that they really are who they say they are. Typically includes passwords, tokens, and certificates.

-   **Critical infrastructure attack**

    Critical infrastructure refers to the physical and cyber structures, facilities, and systems that are essential for a country to function. Attacks on these resources would harm the physical security, economic security, or public health of the country.

-   **Customer**

    Someone who buys goods or services. The customer of an IT service provider is the person or group who defines and agrees the service level targets. The term customers is also sometimes informally used to mean users, for example "this is a customer focused organisation".

-   **Dark web**

    Generic name for encrypted online content that is not indexed by search engines. The information is only accessible with special software or tools.

-   **Data breach**

    An [incident](#incident) where data is accessed in a non-authorised way.

-   **Decryption**

    The reverse of an [encryption](#encryption) process.

-   **Distributed Denial of Service \(DDoS\) attack**

    Legitimate users cannot access computer services, because [threat actors](#threat-actor) are overloading the service with requests. Also referred to as a Denial of Service \(DoS\) attack.

-   **Digital footprint**

    A collection of digital traces left behind by a user, as they do activities online.

-   **Encryption**

    The process of converting human-readable text into unreadable 'disguised' information, or 'ciphertext'. You can see it, but you can't understand it. Only someone with a decryption key can convert \('decrypt'\) the unreadable information back into human-readable form again.

-   **Exfiltrate**

    The formal name for a technique used by [threat actors](#threat-actor) and [malware](#malware) to surreptitiously copy and transfer data out of a system. This is data theft.

-   **Exploit**

    A program or process that takes advantage of a vulnerability in a system to cause system problems, or to access or modify information without authorisation.

-   **Incident**

    Any event which is not part of the standard operation of a service, and which causes, or might cause, an interruption to, or a reduction in, the quality of that service. A breach of the security rules for a system or service.

-   **Incident Management**

    The process responsible for managing the lifecycle of all incidents. The primary objective of incident management is to return the IT service to users as quickly as possible.

-   **Insider threat**

    Any threat from current or former employees of an organisation who have inside information or authorised credentials that might be used to cause harm to the organisation, accidentally or maliciously.

-   **Macro**

    A small program or script that automates tasks in an application, such as Microsoft Office. Might be used by attackers can use to gain access to, or harm, a system.

-   **Malware**

    Malicious software. This includes things like viruses, trojans, worms, or any code that can have a negative impact on an a system.

-   **Multi-factor authentication \(MFA\)**

    Use of two or more different components to verify a user's claimed identity. Typically an extra component, in addition to a [password](#password). MFA often uses an authenticator app or SMS text to deliver a single use code. Also Two-factor authentication \(2FA\).

-   **Open Source Intelligence \(OSINT\)**

    Information gathered from public information including data from public social network accounts, company websites, and other openly available information sources.

-   **Operational Security Team \(OST\)**

    A security team within the MoJ. They can be contacted through email: [security@justice.gov.uk](mailto:security@justice.gov.uk).

-   **Out of band check**

    An additional check performed using a different communication channel, to verify identity or intent. For example, if you receive an email from a senior manager, asking you to perform an unusual task, you would want to check that the request is genuine. If you reply by email to the original request, that's an 'in band' check, and can't be trusted because it's possible the manager's email has been compromised. But if you called the manager by mobile phone to check the request, that's using a different communication technology, so it's an out of band check. A [threat actor](#threat-actor) would have to compromise the manager's email and mobile phone account to succeed in tricking you.

-   **Password**

    A secret string of characters, numbers, and often symbols. When used with a valid user ID, a password enables access to an account.

-   **Patching**

    Applying updates to software or firmware to improve security and enhance functionality.

-   **Phishing**

    Untargeted mass emails sent to many individuals. The email typically asks for sensitive information, or encourages you to visit fake websites, or to send money.

-   **Problem**

    A cause of one or more [incidents](#incident). The cause is not usually known at the time a problem record is created, and the [Problem Management](#problem-management) process is responsible for further investigation.

-   **Problem Management**

    The process responsible for managing the lifecycle of all [problems](#problem). The primary objectives of Problem Management are to prevent [incidents](#incident) from happening, and to minimise the impact of incidents which cannot be prevented.

-   **Process**

    A structured set of activities designed to accomplish a specific objective. A process takes one or more defined inputs and turns them into defined outputs. A process might include any of the roles, responsibilities, tools, and management controls required to deliver the outputs reliably. A process might define policies, standards, guidelines, activities, and work instructions if they are needed.

-   **Ransomware**

    Malicious software that makes data or systems unusable by [encrypting](#encryption) it and then demanding a payment from the victim to [decrypt](#decryption) it. Double Extortion Ransomware [exfiltrates](#exfiltrate) the data before encryption and demands a ransom payment to stop the [threat actor](#threat-actor) releasing the data to the public, as well as for decrypting the system.

-   **Red team**

    This is an internal or external team that tests organisational security by simulating cyber attacks as realistically as possible. Together with the [Blue Team](#blue-team), this helps to improve the cyber defences of the organisation.

-   **Resolution**

    Action taken to repair the fundamental cause of an [incident](#incident) or [problem](#problem), or to implement a workaround.

-   **Resolver Group**

    May include a wide range of IT teams, including support and development personnel, other Service Management Functions \(SMFs\), other units within the organisation, outsourcing providers, partners, and other third parties.

-   **Service Desk**

    The single point of contact between the service provider and the users. A typical Service Desk manages [incidents](#incident) and service requests, and handles communication with the users.

-   **Social engineering**

    Manipulating people into doing things or divulging information that is of use to a [threat actor](#threat-actor).

-   **Tabletop**

-   **Tailgating**

    An unauthorised individual forcefully or stealthily gaining access to a building by entering immediately behind an authorised user.

-   **Threat actor**

    A general term that encompasses all types of individuals and groups that use cyber methods to cause harm. This includes competitors seeking to steal information, cyber criminals attacking for political or monetary gain, accidental or malicious insider threats, spies, social and political activists, and assorted hackers.

-   **Trend Analysis**

    Analysis of data to identify time related patterns. Trend analysis is used in [Problem Management](#problem-management) to identify common failures or fragile configuration items, and in Capacity Management as a modelling tool to predict future behaviour. It is also used as a management tool for identifying deficiencies in IT Service Management Processes.

-   **Virtual Private Network \(VPN\)**

    An [encrypted](#encryption) network created to allow secure connections for remote users.

-   **Vulnerability**

    A weakness in software, a system, or process. A [threat actor](#threat-actor) might seek to exploit a vulnerability to gain unauthorised access to a system.

-   **Zero day \(0day\)**

    A vulnerability in a system that few people know about. [threat actors](#threat-actor) can exploit an 0day to attack or affect data and systems.

-   **Zero trust**

    The assumption that all requests and connections are potential breaches, and so must be verified and authenticated before being allowed.
