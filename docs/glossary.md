## Terms

|Term|Explanation|
|:---|:----------|
|Authorised User|Any user of services covered as authorised by the MoJ.|
|Customer|Someone who buys goods or services. The customer of an IT service provider is the person or group who defines and agrees the service level targets. The term customers is also sometimes informally used to mean users, for example "this is a customer focused organisation".|
|Incident|Any event which is not part of the standard operation of a service, and which causes, or might cause, an interruption to, or a reduction in, the quality of that service.|
|Incident Management|The process responsible for managing the lifecycle of all incidents. The primary objective of incident management is to return the IT service to users as quickly as possible.|
|Problem|A cause of one or more incidents. The cause is not usually known at the time a problem record is created, and the Problem Management process is responsible for further investigation.|
|Problem Management|The process responsible for managing the lifecycle of all problems. The primary objectives of Problem Management are to prevent incidents from happening, and to minimise the impact of incidents which cannot be prevented.|
|Process|A structured set of activities designed to accomplish a specific objective. A process takes one or more defined inputs and turns them into defined outputs. A process might include any of the roles, responsibilities, tools, and management controls required to deliver the outputs reliably. A process might define policies, standards, guidelines, activities, and work instructions if they are needed.|
|Resolution|Action taken to repair the root cause of an incident or problem, or to implement a workaround.|
|Resolver Group|May include a wide range of IT teams, including support and development personnel, other Service Management Functions \(SMFs\), other units within the organisation, outsourcing providers, partners, and other third parties.|
|Service Desk|The single point of contact between the service provider and the users. A typical Service Desk manages incidents and service requests, and handles communication with the users.|
|Trend Analysis|Analysis of data to identify time related patterns. Trend analysis is used in Problem Management to identify common failures or fragile configuration items, and in Capacity Management as a modelling tool to predict future behaviour. It is also used as a management tool for identifying deficiencies in IT Service Management Processes.|
