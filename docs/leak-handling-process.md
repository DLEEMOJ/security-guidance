# Leak handling process

This document provides a high-level overview of the leak handling process for the Ministry of Justice \(MoJ\). It includes the roles, responsibilities, and major steps performed as part of leak handling.

It should be read in conjunction with the associated [leak handling policy](leak-handling-policy.md).

[MoJ Group Security](mailto:mojgroupsecurity@justice.gov.uk) owns the leak handling process. However, the [Operational Security Team](mailto:OperationalSecurityTeam@justice.gov.uk) provides tech support as required, for example performing searches. The analysis and reporting from these teams is an essential security management component in assessing and mitigating current and future leaks that affect MoJ data, systems, networks and solutions.

Send all leak questions or requests for help to [security@justice.gov.uk](mailto:security@justice.gov.uk). This applies to all leaks, suspected or otherwise. Your message is evaluated promptly, and normally passed to [MoJ Group Security](mailto:mojgroupsecurity@justice.gov.uk). Depending on the circumstances, the [Operational Security Team](mailto:OperationalSecurityTeam@justice.gov.uk) might also provide direct advice on a case-by-case basis.

**Note:** Normally, the [MoJ incident management process](it-incident-management-policy.md) is followed at the start of a leak investigation.

**Note:** If a leak investigation indicates that physical examination of evidence is required, then [Operational Security Team](mailto:OperationalSecurityTeam@justice.gov.uk) involvement will involve a Team Lead as a minimum.

**Note:** An informal leak investigation takes place entirely within the MoJ. A formal leak investigation takes place with involvement from outside the MoJ, typically Cabinet Office.

## Process steps

### Step 1: Identify leak

A leak investigation is requested. The request might come from any of:

-   Chief Information Security Officer \(CISO\).
-   Departmental office.
-   Executive office.
-   HMPPS.
-   Ministerial office.
-   MoJ agencies.
-   Permanent Secretary.
-   Senior Civil Servant \(SCS\).
-   Other cross-government source.

The request indicates that a leak investigation is required. The request is submitted to the security 'Front Door': [security@justice.gov.uk](mailto:security@justice.gov.uk).

Proceed to [step 2](#step-2-is-it-a-leak).

### Step 2: Is it a leak?

The security team evaluates the request.

If the situation is indeed a leak, the request is sent to [MoJ Group Security](mailto:mojgroupsecurity@justice.gov.uk). Proceed to [Require informal leak investigation](#require-informal-leak-investigation).

If the situation is not a leak, or it is not clear whether the situation is a leak, the request is sent to [Operational Security Team](mailto:OperationalSecurityTeam@justice.gov.uk). Proceed to step 2.2.

### Step 2.1: Require informal leak investigation

Group Security reviews the request to determine if a leak investigation is required.

If a leak investigation is needed, go to step 2.1.1.

If a leak investigation is not needed, go to step 2.1.2
