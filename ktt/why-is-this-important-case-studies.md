# Why is this important - Case studies

## A victim’s experience of a data breach

**A domestic violence victim shares how she was impacted after her address was disclosed to the perpetrator:**

*"This has impacted deeply and taken me back to those early awful hard days. This incident isn't just one simple mistake, it's a massive piece in years of getting through often day by day having been a victim of domestic violence. It's taken me back all that way, the thoughts the sleepless nights, the worry the panic, those moments, the what ifs, how's this happened, the constant checking outside, checking through the windows. Days I thought were gone, as I was in my safe place, my home, this one escape, our place of safety is just gone, it's just taken away.*

*Now if I go out on the school run I'm out first checking who's around, I bring the children out supervised, no longer can they go to the car to put the school bag in on their own, we're back being vigilant, careful watching. checking looking, back thinking again 'what if'?"*

## A staff member’s experience of a data breach

**A member of staff describes how it felt to have accidentally disclosed an adoptive child's new address to the child’s birth parents.**

*“Even now some months on the thought of the consequences of my actions makes me feel physically sick. I know my mistake has de-stabilised the family, they were forced to move from their family and friends and from their home. Their place of comfort and sanctuary because they couldn't live in fear of the natural parents making contact with the child, or even worse attempted to kidnap the child.*

*I will forever be sorry for the mistake I made. I know I will never be able to rectify the consequences, but I will never make the same mistake again."*
