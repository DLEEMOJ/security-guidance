# IT Health Check - Tests cancellations and delays

Once ITHC execution dates are agreed it is assumed that all parties
have a baselined scope, delivery timeline and resource plans finalised
(or very close too)
whilst in addition,
any ITHC risks / issues / dependencies are known and action plans in place.
It is understood however that on occasion, even the best laid plans are challenged when unknown
and last-minute issues arise.
In these scenario's it is important and recommended that all parties collaborate
to discuss the potential impact to ITHC and work together to
resolve/reduce that impact.

However, project teams should be aware that, if the issue originates from within the project
and, after collaboration the ITHC dates are impacted, delay / cancellation charges that will apply
and cross-charged back to the project team.

For guidance and illustrative purposes, please see the tables below:

## External Vendor test team delay / cancellation charge table

| Days before test start | Charge | Cross charge |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 30 | 50% of total testing cost scheduled | £900/resource/day |
| 14 | 100% of total testing cost scheduled | £900/resource/day |

## Internal Security test team delay / cancellation charge table

| Days before test start | Event | Charge | Cross charge |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 7 | Test delayed by > 2 days | 50% of total testing cost scheduled | £600 rate per person day of overall test resourcing |
| 7 | Test delayed by < 2 days | 50% of testing cost scheduled for the 2 days scheduled | 2 x num testers x £600 |
| 3 | Testing delayed or cancelled | 75% of testing cost scheduled | Num testers x days x £600 |
| 7 | Test cancelled | 40% of total testing cost scheduled | Total test person days scheduled x £600 x 40% |
