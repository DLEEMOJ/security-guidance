# Security Culture Programme

The Security Culture Programme aims to strengthen our security culture through raising awareness, sharing knowledge, best practise and resources, and aspires to ensure our security is second to none.

We’ve developed a Security Culture Programme that we are seeking to roll out across the different directorates in HQ and our agencies/arms lengths bodies.

## *Security Culture Survey

In order to improve security behaviours in the Department, we need to gain greater insight into the issues from our employee’s perspective. We're currently piloting a security culture survey in Digital & Technology, and plan to roll this out MoJ-wide after the summer. Please contact Dawn Carrington if you are happy to promote this in your team.

## Joiners, Movers and Leavers (JML)

### Improving our JML Processes

When somebody joins, moves or leaves the Department, there are certain security procedures which must be followed to ensure a safe environment for us all.

### JML Toolkit
Lne managers now have access to a [JML Toolkit](https://intranet.justice.gov.uk/documents/2021/03/joiners-movers-leavers-toolkit.pdf), which outlines the processes and forms they must princess when anybody joins, moves or leaves their team. .

## Corporate Inductions

These are the foundation to any organisation’s security culture. A culture is built from day one - either actively, or passively. It is therefore essential to instil security messages as soon as somebody joins us. We also need our People Managers to ensure that MoJ’s security processes are followed for new joiners in their first week:

1. Complete CSL’s Responsible for Information eLearning
2. Watch the security induction video (please note this will be replaced by a new 20 minute induction video on MyLearning later in 2021.
3. Read Your Guide to Being Security Aware

## Leader’s Induction

We have a Leader’s security induction, which is usually delivered on a 121 basis for new leaders / SCS (currently via MS teams).

## Awareness & Training

There are a number of awareness and training sessions, and materials available for helping to improve our people’s security behaviours. These include monthly Line Manager training, intranet Awareness Sessions, which are accessible via the intranet Event’s page.

## Security Champion network

We are building a network of [security champions](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/security-guidance/blob/Local/culture/security-champions.md) to help embed security behaviour change at a local level. These are an evidence-based intervention for creating behavioural change.

## Internal Engagement

We've developed an annual security engagement plan [link to short copy of engagement plan], which aims to improve security behaviours in four different areas during the next 12 months; remote working, returning to the office, cyber hygiene and incident reporting. We would like People Managers to support this by doing things like; sharing the Team Briefs we will be producing on these topics, putting up posters in their kitchen areas, using and making security a standing agenda item on their team meetings, and participating in engagement activities as requested by security champions or our Chief Security Officer during each quarter.

## Security Academy

We are launching a platform to host the latest security policy, resources, best practise and guidance, to collaborate, and to deliver security training a training academy. Initially this will be for our security champions, but the intention is to eventually make this a best practise forum for government security, accessible to all employees and civil servants.
