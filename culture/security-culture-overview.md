# Our Security Culture

As a major government department, the MoJ handles vast amounts of data on behalf of some very vulnerable service users. Small actions by our people can have big consequences for individuals, the department and our reputation.

Our Security culture determines how people think about and approach security. Getting it right helps to develop a more security-conscious workforce, and promotes the desired security behaviours from our people.

Everyone who works for us, whether an employee, contractor or supplier, has a role to play in keeping the Department safe and secure. Your behaviours are what can protect us (or not) from the range of threats that exist, which have the potential to cause physical, reputational or financial harm to our service users, your colleagues or the Department.

The benefits of an effective security culture include:

- A workforce that are more likely to be engaged with, and take responsibility for, security issues
- Increased compliance with protective security measures
- Awareness of the most relevant security threats
- Employees are more likely to think and behave in a security-conscious manner

​​​​​​​Within these pages, you’ll find a range of training and awareness materials, and events, designed to help us develop our security culture. We are encouraging people to actively share these across the Department, to build awareness of the little things we can all do to help.
