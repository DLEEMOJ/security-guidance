# Our Security Culture

As a major government department, the MoJ handles vast amounts of data on behalf of some very vulnerable service users. Small actions by our people can have big consequences for individuals, the department and our reputation.

Everyone who works for us, whether an employee, contractor or supplier, has a role to play in keeping our data, service users, colleagues and buildings safe and secure.

Major components of Our Security Culture are:

- [A Security Culture Programme](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/security-guidance/blob/Local/culture/security-culture-programme.md)
- [Security Champions](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/security-guidance/blob/Local/culture/security-champions.md)
- [Events](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/security-guidance/blob/Local/culture/events.md)
- Resources to share (Leaflets, posters, quizzes, worksheets, team briefs)
