# Our Security Culture

As a major government department, the @mojlong@ handles vast amounts of data on
behalf of some very vulnerable service users. Small actions by our people can
have big consequences for individuals, the department and our reputation.

Our Security culture determines how people think about and approach security.
Getting it right helps to develop a more security-conscious workforce, and
promotes the desired security behaviours from our people.

Everyone who works for us, whether an employee, contractor or supplier, has a
role to play in keeping the @moj@ safe and secure. Your behaviours are what can
protect us (or not) from the range of threats that exist, which have the
potential to cause physical, reputational or financial harm to our service
users, your colleagues or the @moj@.

The benefits of an effective security culture include:

- A workforce that are more likely to be engaged with, and take responsibility for, security issues.
- Increased compliance with protective security measures.
- Awareness of the most relevant security threats.
- Employees are more likely to think and behave in a security-conscious manner.

​​​​​​​Within these pages, you’ll find a range of training and awareness materials, and
events, designed to help us develop our security culture. We are encouraging
people to actively share these across the Department, to build awareness of the
little things we can all do to help.
