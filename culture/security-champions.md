# Security Champions

We are currently building a network of Security Champions across the @mojlong@
HQ to promote good security behaviours and strengthen the @moj@'s security
culture.
Security Champions help promote and build awareness and knowledge of the
procedures and security behaviours that staff and contractors need to
demonstrate while working at the @moj@.

Their role includes:

- Helping to spread good security practice and behaviours both within and beyond their own teams.
- Two way communications of security messages.
- Facilitating local security awareness workshops and action planning.
- Celebrating successes and identifying areas for improvement.
- Being enthusiastic and committed change agents.

The role is voluntary and should take no longer than 2-3 hours per month, and
will need to be done in addition to your day job. Therefore, permission must be
granted by your line manager.

## Training available

For all those who are new Security Champions, you will receive a Welcome session
introducing you to the role. Following this there are many learning and
development opportunities throughout the year through various workshops in
engagement, behaviour change, and security and privacy related topics.

If you are interested in becoming a Security Champion, please email (copying
your line manager): @dawncarringtontext@ with the following information: name,
directorate, role/grade, contact number.

## MS Teams Group

Security Champions will be able to collaborate via the Security Champion
Microsoft Teams group, which enables champions to talk to each other and share
information across the @moj@. Details will be shared at a Welcome session.
