People managers are invited to attend this Security Bootcamp. Thousands of our people have now changed to home and hybrid working, which has significantly changed our security threat landscape, and culture.

This 90-minute interactive Bootcamp will help you get to grips with the main risks and policies you need to be aware of, and you will learn how to reinforce positive security behaviours in your team.

​​​​​​​Some pre-reading and a short post-attendance exercise will be required in addition to the workshop. Please sign up via Eventbrite:​​
