# Malware Protection Guide: Defensive Layer 1

## Introduction

This guide explains the types of controls that need to be implemented to form the first of three layers of defence. Layer 1 reduces the likelihood that malicious content will reach the MoJ network through implementing the controls outlined in this guide. This guide is a sub-page to the [Malware Protection Guide](malware-protection-guide-introduction).

## Defensive Layer 1: Preventing malicious code from being delivered to devices

| Do |
|---|
| ✔ Ensure that all public facing IP addresses owned or managed on behalf of the MoJ are protected by enrolling them in the Public Sector DNS service. If you create a new public facing IP address you must inform the Cyber Assistance Team of the IP address so they can add it to the MoJ [Protective Domain Naming Service subscription](../../security_decisions/guides/public-sector-dns/) and include it in the MoJ Protective Monitoring Solution. As a Central Government department, the MoJ is permitted to use the service for free, but suppliers to the MoJ are not. |
| ✔  Ensure that if you are developing a system or application where any element is outsourced, such as hosting a service in the cloud, you must understand and record security related responsibilities of the MoJ, of the cloud service provider and any other supplier. For guidance on what responsibilities to consider, see the [NCSC guidance on Cloud Security](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/collection/cloud-security) or ISO27017. These provide guidelines for information security controls applicable to the provision and use of cloud services. |
| ✔Ensure that if you are managing an email system, all inbound emails to the MoJ are scanned for malware. For Microsoft systems this is provided by Office 365 which quarantines any suspected malware. This is then analysed by the Managed Service Provider and the Operational Security Team (OST). |
| ✔ Avoid the need for Removable Media by using existing approved online collaboration services where possible e.g. Office 365. Where removable media has to be used, it must be scanned by Anti-virus upon connection and prior to use. One option is to adopt a sheep dip, a segregated terminal with anti-virus, which can be used to conduct these scans before data is introduced to the system. Removable Media must be used with caution and its provenance known. |
| ✔All web traffic must be routed via a Proxy  which has whitelisting and Anti-virus enabled. Email must also be routed through email scanning services. Direct Internet access should only be configured for update services and by exception only. |
| ✔ Allow the installation of applications only from approved stores.|
| ✔ Systems must be kept up-to-date with OS and application upgrades and patches. Where possible, software updates should be configured to update automatically. All systems must have approved maintenance windows to allow for updates to be applied while minimising system/user impact. See the [Vulnerability Scanning and Patch Management Guide][vspmg] for further information. |
| ✔ All firewall configuration changes require approval through a formal process before being made. |
| ✔ Be aware of the risks of watering hole attacks using GitHub or other open source code repositories. Appropriate access controls help to reduce the risk of watering hole attacks. See the Access Control Guide for further information.|
| ✔ Ensure that if you are developing a new system, that the appropriate anti-malware software  is configured to regularly scan it. You must also ensure that the system is configured so that scans by the anti-malware software do not interfere with the system or application performance. Contact the OST for further information on how to do this.|
| ✔ Ensure that if you are responsible for patching or installing security updates of an in-house developed system or application follow the processes and requirements set out in the [Vulnerability Scanning and Patch Management Guide][vspmg]. The success of these updates should be validated using automated vulnerability scanning services.|
| ✔ Use hardened devices including approved and assured Gold Builds. Further information can be found in the Technical Controls guide. |

| Don't |
|---|
| ✖ Allow externally obtained executable software, including auto-running macros, obtained from outside the MoJ, to run. |
| ✖ Try to circumvent any security controls such as safe browsing lists or removable media controls as they are in place to protect the MoJ from malware. |
| ✖ Connect any devices not procured and/or managed by the MoJ to trusted networks, unless they are under device management. |
