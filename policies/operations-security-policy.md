### Change management

Changes to the organisation, business processes, information processing facilities and systems that affect information security should be controlled.

### Capacity management

The use of resources should be monitored, tuned and projections made of future capacity requirements to ensure the required system performance.

### Separation of development, testing and operational environments
Development, testing, and operational environments should be separated to reduce the risks of unauthorised access or changes to the operational environment.

## Protection from malware
Ensure that information and information processing facilities are protected against malware.

### Controls against malware

Detection, prevention and recovery controls to protect against malware should be implemented, combined with appropriate user awareness.

Malware Protection

### Management of technical vulnerabilities

Information about technical vulnerabilities of information systems being used should be obtained in a timely fashion, the organisation’s exposure to such vulnerabilities evaluated and appropriate measures taken to address the associated risk.

### Restrictions on software installation

Rules governing the installation of software by users should be established and implemented.

Vulnerability Scanning
Patch Management
Configuration Patching and Change
Vulnerability Disclosure

## Information systems audit considerations
