# Using GMail's Confidential Mode

## What is Confidential Mode?

Gmail's confidential mode can help prevent your emails and attachments from being seen by unauthorised users.
If you send a message in confidential mode, Google attempts to prevent forwarding, copying, printing or downloading of the email or any of its attachments.

You can also give a message an expiration date. Expired messages are not deleted but become inaccessible to the recipient. As long as you keep a copy you can remove access to an email at any time. You can also have Google create a passcode, delivered via email or text message, that's required to open the message.

If you have given a message an expiration date, it is no longer readable on the recipient's system but it remains available to you either in your sent folder or in the folder where you have stored it.

You can make any message confidential by clicking an icon at the foot of the Compose window.

## When should I use it

You can use confidential mode if your email or attachment contains OFFICIAL - SENSITIVE information.

## When shouldn't I use it

Gmail **should not** be used to send SECRET or TOP SECRET information.

Sending SECRET and TOP SECRET by email requires a highly secure infrastructure beyond that provided by Gmail, even when using Confidential mode.

**Note**: Confidential mode is Google's name for this service. It should not be confused with the old protective marking of CONFIDENTIAL.

## How to get it
Confidential Mode is installed with Gmail, as standard, on all MoJ laptops and MacBooks.

## How does Gmail process confidential mode messages

When you send a message using confidential mode, Gmail removes the message body and any attachments from the recipient's copy.

Upon receipt, the body and attachment(s) are replaced with a link to the content. Gmail clients display the linked content as if it's part of the message. Third-party mail clients display a link in place of the content.

## Limitations

Although confidential mode helps prevent recipients from accidentally sharing an email, it doesn't prevent them from taking screenshots or photos of messages or attachments.

If recipients have any malicious programs on their computer they may still be able to copy or download your messages or attachments.

Messages aren't encrypted in any end-to-end manner. This means that Google operatives could, if they wished, view and store them.

If you want to include an expiry date, you have to select it from a pre-set list, you cannot set your own.

If you want to send a passcode you will need to enter a phone number for each recipient.

## Handling instructions

Even though emails and their attachments cannot be forwarded or printed, the recipient is able to take screenshots and these could be printed, saved and sent on. For this reason, you should still include message handling instructions at the start of your emails.

For example, you should include **OFFICIAL - SENSITIVE** at the start of the Subject line in the email header and also write **OFFICIAL - SENSITIVE** at the start of the email itself.

## Using confidential mode

1. In Gmail, click Compose to open a new email window.

2. Click ![](https://ministryofjustice.github.io/security-guidance/images/Confid_Clock) at the foot of the window. The Confidential mode dialogue displays. **Note**: Confidential Mode is turned off by default unless you are replying to an email that was sent
to you as confidential in which case it is automatically set to 'on'. To turn it off, click ![](https://ministryofjustice.github.io/security-guidance/images/Confid_Clock).

3. Set an expiry date and, if required, a passcode. The default is for the message to expire in one week and for no SMS passcode. These settings apply to both the message text and any attachments. The shortest expiry period is one day. The longest is five years.

 All confidential messages have an expiry date.

 **Note**: If you choose **No SMS passcode**, recipients using Gmail will be able to open it immediately. Recipients who don't use Gmail are emailed a passcode by Google.

 If you choose **SMS passcode**, Gmail recipients are sent a passcode in a text message. Users of other email systems may receive the code in a second email. You will need to enter a phone number for each recipient. You are prompted to do this immediately after you click **Send**.

4. Click **Save**. You can now write and send the email in the normal way.

## Remove access early

After sending an email, you can stop recipients from viewing it before the expiry date that you have previously set.

**Note**: If the email was sent to more than one recipient, then all of them will be stopped from viewing the email. You cannot prevent one recipient from viewing the email while allowing others to continue to see it.

1. Go to Gmail's **Sent** folder (or the location where you have stored the email).

2. Open the confidential email.

3. Click on the 'Three Dots' menu on the top right of the email.

4. Click **Remove Access**. The email immediately becomes unreadable to the recipient. You can allow the email to be read again by clicking **Restore Access**.

## Deleting confidential emails

You can delete confidential emails at any time.

If you delete a confidential email it will no longer be available to the recipient, even if there is time remaining before its expiry date. A warning message displays asking you to confirm that you want to delete the email.
