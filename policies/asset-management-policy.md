# Asset Management Policy

## Introduction

This policy gives an overview of information security principles and responsibilities within the Ministry of Justice (MoJ) and provides a summary of the MoJ's related policies and guides in relation to information security.

## Who is it for?

This policy is aimed at:
- **Technical users:** these are in-house MoJ Digital and Technology staff who are responsible for implementing controls throughout technical design, development, system integration and operation. This includes DevOps, Software Developers, Technical Architects and Service Owners. It also includes Incident Managers from the Event, Problem, Incident, CSI and Knowledge (EPICK) Team.
- **Service Providers:** defined as any other MoJ business group, agency, contractor, IT supplier and partner who in any way designs, develops or supplies services (including processing, transmitting and storing data) for, or on behalf of the MoJ.
- **General users:** all other staff working for the MoJ.

'All MoJ users' refers to General users, Technical users and Service Providers as defined above.

## Responsibility for assets

### Inventory of assets

Assets associated with information and information processing facilities must be identified and an inventory of these assets must be drawn up and maintained. Moj must identify assets relevant in the lifecycle of information and document their importance. The lifecycle of information must include:

- creation
- processing
- storage
- transmission
- deletion
- destruction

Documentation must be maintained in dedicated or existing inventories as appropriate. The asset inventory must be accurate, up to date, consistent and aligned with other inventories. For each of the identified assets, ownership of the asset must be assigned and the classification must be identified.

Inventories of assets help to ensure that effective protection takes place, and may also be required for other purposes, such as health and safety, insurance or financial (asset management) reasons.

### Ownership of assets

All assets maintained in the inventory must be owned. Individuals as well as other entities having approved management responsibility for the asset lifecycle
qualify to be assigned as asset owners. Ownership must be assigned when assets are created or when assets are transferred to the MoJ. The asset owner must be responsible for the proper management of an asset over the whole asset lifecycle.

The identified owner can be either an individual or an entity who has approved management responsibility for controlling the whole lifecycle of an asset. The identified owner does not necessarily have any property rights to the asset. Routine tasks may be delegated, for example, to a custodian looking after the assets on a daily basis, but the responsibility remains with the owner.

In complex information systems, it may be useful to designate groups of assets which act together to provide a particular service. In this case the owner of this service is accountable for the delivery of the service, including the operation of its assets.

### Acceptable use of assets

Rules for the acceptable use of information and of assets associated with information and information processing facilities must be identified, documented and implemented.

MoJ employees and external parties using or having access to the MoJ's assets must be made aware of the information security requirements of the MoJ's assets associated with information and information processing facilities and resources. They should be responsible for their use of any information processing resources and of any such use carried out under their responsibility.

### Return of assets

All MoJ employees and external parties should return all of the MoJ assets in their possession upon termination of their employment, contract or agreement.

## Information classification

Information classification must ensure that information receives an appropriate level of protection in accordance with its importance to the MoJ.

### Classification of information

Information must be classified in terms of legal requirements, value, criticality and sensitivity to unauthorised disclosure or modification. Owners of information assets must be accountable for their classification. The classification scheme must include conventions for classification and criteria for review of the classification over time.

### Labelling of information

An appropriate set of procedures for information labelling must be developed and implemented in accordance with the MoJ's information classification scheme. Labelling of classified information is a key requirement for information sharing arrangements. Physical labels and metadata are a common form of labelling.

###  Handling of assets

Procedures for handling assets must be developed and implemented in accordance with the MoJ's information classification scheme. Procedures must be drawn up for handling, processing, storing and communicating information consistent with its classification.

## Media handling

This section details controls preventing unauthorised disclosure, modification, removal or destruction of information stored on media.

###  Management of removable media

Procedures must be implemented for the management of removable media in accordance with the MoJ's classification scheme. These procedures and authorisation levels must be documented.

###  Disposal of media

Media must be disposed of securely when no longer required, using formal procedures. These procedures must be established to minimise the risk of confidential information leakage to unauthorised persons. The procedures for secure disposal of media containing confidential information must be proportional to the sensitivity of that information.

When accumulating media for disposal, consideration must be given to the aggregation effect, which can cause a large quantity of non-sensitive information to become sensitive.

Damaged devices containing sensitive data may require a risk assessment to determine whether the items should be physically destroyed rather than sent for repair or discarded

###  Physical media transfer

Media containing information must be protected against unauthorised access, misuse or corruption during transportation. When confidential information on media is not encrypted, additional physical protection of the media must be considered.

## Enforcement

This policy is enforced by lower level policies, standards, procedures and guidance. Non-conformance with this policy could result in disciplinary action taken in accordance with the departmentâ€™s Disciplinary procedures. This could result in penalties up to and including dismissal. If an employee commits a criminal offence, s/he may also be prosecuted. In such cases, the department will always cooperate with the relevant authorities, and provide appropriate evidence.
