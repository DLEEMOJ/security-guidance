# Video and Voice Conferencing Best Practice
With so many of us working from home, video conferencing has quickly become part of our daily routine. But just because something is familiar doesn't mean that we should close our eyes to the security risks that it can present.

You should always be aware of your working environment when you work with MoJ information. If anyone else might see the data, or hear you talk about it as you use it, that may cause privacy problems.

## Scope
This guidance sets out best practice and you should follow it to make sure that your video and voice calls are as secure as possible. It applies equally to both hosts and attendees. It is not specific to any one application and applies to Microsoft Teams, Zoom, Google Meet, or Skype.

**Note**: this guidance does not apply to Broadcast sessions such as All Staff meetings.

## Before the call

* Only send meeting invitations to people who you need to attend.


* If someone has not been invited that you think should attend, ask the meeting organiser to send them an invitation. Do not forward one yourself.


* Turn off or unplug any smart devices (such as Google Home, Amazon Echo or Dot), or mobile phone apps (such as Google Assistant or Siri), if they are in the room where you are conducting video conferences or phone calls.


* Make sure your video conferencing account (or the device or app you are using for video conferencing) is protected with a strong password. If possible and appropriate, use multi-factor authentication (MFA).


* Test the service before making or joining your first call. Familiarise yourself with the call environment and the available in-call options, such as recording the call, file sharing and online chat.


* Consider your surroundings. Check what can be seen behind you or on your desk. Information on a whiteboard or pin board may be visible on screen. In this case, use the application's blur screen function or select a fake background. You should test this before the call to make sure that sensitive information is concealed.


* If you need to share an agenda before the meeting, make sure that it does not contain any personal details, either of attendees or of people who may be discussed during the call.


* If possible, prevent calls from being made public by including a password with the meeting invitation. Ideally, and especially for meetings involving sensitive information, send the password by a separate channel. This will prevent an unauthorised person getting all the access information they need in one message.

## During the call
* **For larger meetings, it is not possible to see all of the attendees and most may simply display as initials or a profile picture. In this case you should behave as if the meeting is public and refrain from discussing anything that could not, legitimately, be visible in the public domain.**


* Check that only verified people ask to join, or have joined, the meeting.


* Ask participants to identify themselves, their role and their organisation before you begin. Keep a list of the participants to hand.


* Make sure all participants display their names during the meeting. It may also be useful for them to include their role.


* Monitor attendance throughout the meeting. It is perfectly acceptable for anyone to check who is present at any time: good security hygiene takes precedence over conventional etiquette. You should show participants in 'gallery view' so that you can see who is on the call.


* Stop the meeting if you are unsure about who is present. Take a roll call if necessary. Bear in mind that 'losing' a couple of minutes to do this is trivial in comparison to the time and resources required to address a problem if something goes wrong as a result of an unauthorised attendance.


* When you share screens with external parties, ensure that your email and open documents are not displayed. Be aware that instant messaging or other notifications might suddenly 'pop up' at any time; the notification summaries might contain information that is inappropriate for the meeting.


* Do not record the call unless it is essential. Remember that all recordings (and any shared documents) are stored in the Cloud and may be accessible by people who were not invited to the meeting. If you do record, make sure that all attendees have given their permission and that no sensitive details are included (this includes any personal information).


* Be aware of your audience. You should tailor the meeting's content when participants include external parties who may not have non-disclosure agreements and could make information public.
