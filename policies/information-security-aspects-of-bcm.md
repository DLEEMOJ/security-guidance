# Information Security Aspects of BCM

## Introduction

This policy gives an overview of information security principles and responsibilities within the Ministry of Justice (MoJ) and provides a summary of the MoJ's related policies and guides in relation to information security.

## Who is it for?

This policy is aimed at:
- **Technical users:** these are in-house MoJ Digital and Technology staff who are responsible for implementing controls throughout technical design, development, system integration and operation. This includes DevOps, Software Developers, Technical Architects and Service Owners. It also includes Incident Managers from the Event, Problem, Incident, CSI and Knowledge (EPICK) Team.
- **Service Providers:** defined as any other MoJ business group, agency, contractor, IT supplier and partner who in any way designs, develops or supplies services (including processing, transmitting and storing data) for, or on behalf of the MoJ.
- **General users:** all other staff working for the MoJ.

'All MoJ users' refers to General users, Technical users and Service Providers as defined above.

## Information security continuity

Information security continuity shall be embedded in the MoJ’s business continuity management systems.

## Planning information security continuity

The MoJ must determine its requirements for information security and the continuity of information security management in adverse situations, e.g. during a crisis or disaster.

The MoJ should determine whether the continuity of information security is captured within the business continuity management process or within the disaster recovery management process. Information security requirements should be determined when planning for business continuity and disaster recovery.

In the absence of formal business continuity and disaster recovery planning, information security management should assume that information security requirements remain the same in adverse situations, compared to normal operational conditions.

Alternatively, a business impact analysis for information security aspects to determine the information security requirements applicable to adverse situations can be performed.

## Implementing information security continuity

The MoJ must establish, document, implement and maintain processes, procedures and controls to ensure the required level of continuity for information security during an adverse  situation.

## Verify, review and evaluate information security continuity

The MoJ should verify the established and implemented information security continuity controls at regular intervals in order to ensure that they are valid and effective during adverse situations.

Organisational, technical, procedural and process changes, whether in an operational or continuity context, can lead to changes in information security continuity requirements. In such cases, the continuity of processes, procedures and controls for information security should be reviewed against these changed requirements.
