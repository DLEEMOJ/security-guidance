# Malware Protection Guide: Defensive Layer 3

## Introduction

This guide explains the types of controls that need to be implemented to form the third of three layers of defence. Layer 3 helps reduce the impact of malware infection by reducing the ability for malware to move across networks and by ensuring that data is backed up. This guide is a sub-page to the [Malware Protection Guide](../malware-protection-guide-introduction/).

## Defensive Layer 3: Resilience and Rapid Response

Even with the controls created by defensive layers 1 and 2, it is still possible that malware may reside and execute on the MoJ networks. The following controls can help to build resilience, ensure a rapid response to infection and reduce the impact of a successful malware intrusion:

<table>
<tr><th>Do</th></tr>
<tr><td>✔ Ensure that platforms which are no-longer supported by the vendor or supported by in-house teams are segregated from the rest of the network. The NCSC provides guidance on how to implement <a href="https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/guidance/obsolete-platforms-security-guidance">segregation of unsupported platforms</a>.</td></tr>
<tr><td>✔ If you are designing a system, ensure that it can make regular back-ups of data to limit the amount of data corrupted, encrypted or lost if infected with malware.</td></tr>
<tr><td>✔ Ensure that backups:<ul>
<li>can be recovered. Some cloud providers allow a restoration of data from a point in time. This can be helpful if malware affects the cloud backup.</li>
<li>have an offline copy held in a separate location to the primary data storage. These are called cold back-ups and should be unaffected if an incident affects the primary environment</li>
<li>are refreshed regularly. The regularity of backups will be outlined in the system's Information Risk Assessment Report and agreed with the Business Continuity Team</li></ul>
The <a href="https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/blog-post/offline-backups-in-an-online-world">NCSC</a> provide further guidance on data backups stored in public cloud environments.</td></tr>
<tr><td>✔ Make sure that user permissions are regularly reviewed and access to systems or drives no longer required by users are removed. This is especially important for administrator accounts. See the <a href="../access-control-guide/">Access Control Guide</a> for further information.</td></tr>
<tr><td>✔ If you are managing a system, ensure that backups are conducted in line with the system requirements outlined in the Information Risk Assessment Report.</td></tr>
<tr><td>✔ Prioritise patches and updates of devices that perform security-related functions on the MoJ network (such as firewalls) and any device on the network boundary. See the <a href="../vulnerability-scanning-and-patch-management-guide/">Vulnerability Scanning and Patch Management Guide</a> for further details.</td></tr>
<tr><td>✔ Conduct regular audits of the software and data held on systems which support critical business processes to check if they have been modified by malicious code.</td></tr>
<tr><td>✔ Isolate critical MoJ environments from the wider network to avoid significant business impact that may occur if the wider network is compromised by malware.</td></tr>

| ✖ Use the same browser to conduct administrative activities such as changing access privileges that you use for general user activities such as searching the internet. Separating browsers for different activities can reduce the impact of malware attacks. |
| ✖ Delay implementing security patches on infrastructure when possible. See the [Vulnerability Scanning and Patch Management Guide](../vulnerability-scanning-and-patch-management-guide/) for further information. |
| ✖ Delay if you suspect a malware incident has occurred. Make sure you contact the Technology Service Desk immediately.|

## Preventing and Detecting Lateral Movement

One of the most important ways of limiting the spread of malware on the network is to reduce lateral movement. The main ways to prevent lateral movement are covered in the tables below.

| Do |
|--- |
| ✔ Make sure user credentials are protected through the use of strong passwords which are stored securely. See the [Password Guide](../password-management-guide/) for further information. |
| ✔ Ensure that effective access controls are designed and implemented in MoJ systems, including using Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA). See the [Access Control Guide](../access-control-guide/) for further information. |
| ✔ Make sure you protect highly privileged accounts through applying the principle of least privilege. See the [Access Control Guide](../access-control-guide/) for further information. |
| ✔ Ensure that any system or application running on the MoJ's networks can collect and share system logs with the Operational Security Team's (OST) central monitoring function. This allows the MoJ to detect lateral movement by malware. |
| ✔ Use tools for monitoring account activity and look for indicators of account compromise. These include using Conditional Access to manage access to the network through impossible travel to raise security alerts and prevent a breach.  |
| ✔ Where Bring your Own Device (BYOD) is Permitted to access MoJ information, make sure your device runs anti-malware software and follows the requirements in the BYOD guide. Also ensure that users can only access MoJ emails through approved applications. |
| ✔ If you are designing or modifying networks, practice network segregation for systems and data that do not need to interact. This segregation can be achieved using physical or logical separation. Access between network domains is allowed but must be controlled at the perimeter using a gateway such as a firewall. |

| Don't |
|---|
| ✖ Access emails through third party applications which the MoJ has not approved of, if you are doing so via your own device BYOD. |
| ✖ Allow access to information on devices by default. Restrict access on devices to need to know. |
| ✖ Use your administrator account for any non-admin functions. Access should only be elevated for the tasks required. See the Privileged User guide for further information. |
