# Communications Security Policy

## Introduction

This policy gives an overview of information security principles and responsibilities within the Ministry of Justice (MoJ) and provides a summary of the MoJ's related policies and guides in relation to information security.

## Who is it for?

This policy is aimed at:
- **Technical users:** these are in-house MoJ Digital and Technology staff who are responsible for implementing controls throughout technical design, development, system integration and operation. This includes DevOps, Software Developers, Technical Architects and Service Owners. It also includes Incident Managers from the Event, Problem, Incident, CSI and Knowledge (EPICK) Team.
- **Service Providers:** defined as any other MoJ business group, agency, contractor, IT supplier and partner who in any way designs, develops or supplies services (including processing, transmitting and storing data) for, or on behalf of the MoJ.
- **General users:** all other staff working for the MoJ.

'All MoJ users' refers to General users, Technical users and Service Providers as defined above.

## Network security management

Network security management practices must ensure the protection of MoJ's information in networks and its supporting information processing facilities.

### Network controls

Networks must be managed and controlled to protect MoJ's information in/and its systems and applications. Controls must be documented and implemented to ensure the security of MoJ's information in networks and the protection of its connected services from unauthorised access.

### Security of network services

Network services include the provision of connections, private network services and value added networks and managed network security solutions such as firewalls and intrusion detection systems. These services can range from simple unmanaged bandwidth to complex value-added offerings.

Security mechanisms, service levels and management requirements of all network services must be identified and included in network services agreements, whether these services are provided in-house or outsourced.

The ability of the network service provider to manage agreed services in a secure way must be determined and regularly monitored, and the right to audit must be agreed.

### Segregation in networks

One method of managing the security of large networks is to divide them into separate network domains. The criteria for segregation of networks into domains, and the access allowed through the gateways, must be based on an assessment of the security requirements of each domain. The assessment must be in accordance with the access control policy, access requirements, value and classification of information processed, and also take account of the relative cost and performance impact of incorporating suitable gateway technology.

Wireless networks require special treatment due to the poorly defined network perimeter. For sensitive environments, consideration must be made to treat all wireless access as external connections and to segregate this access from internal networks until the access has passed through a gateway in accordance with network controls policy before granting access to internal systems.

## Information transfer

Proper information transfer practices must be implemented to maintain the security of information transferred within the MoJ and with any external entity.

### Information transfer policies and procedures

Formal transfer policies, procedures and controls must be in place to protect the transfer of information through the use of all types of communication facilities.

Information transfer may occur through the use of a number of different types of communication facilities, including electronic mail, voice, facsimile and video.

Software transfer may occur through a number of different mediums, including downloading from the Internet and acquisition from vendors selling off-the-shelf products.

The MoJ must consider the business, legal and security implications associated with electronic data interchange, electronic commerce and electronic communications.

### Agreements on information transfer

The MoJ must have agreements in place to address the secure transfer of business information between the MoJ and external parties. These agreements must reference any relevant policies, standards or guidance documents which support the protection fo information and physical media in transit.

Agreements may be electronic or manual, and may take the form of formal contracts.

### Electronic messaging

There are many types of electronic messaging such as email, electronic data interchange and social networking which play a role in business communications. MoJ must ensure that information involved in electronic messaging is appropriately protected.

### Confidentiality or non-disclosure agreements

Confidentiality and non-disclosure agreements protect the MoJ information and inform signatories of their responsibility to protect, use and disclose information in a responsible and authorised manner. Requirements for confidentiality or non-disclosure agreements reflecting the MoJ's needs for the protection of information must be identified, regularly reviewed and documented.

## Enforcement

This policy is enforced by lower level policies, standards, procedures and guidance. Non-conformance with this policy could result in disciplinary action taken in accordance with the departmentâ€™s Disciplinary procedures. This could result in penalties up to and including dismissal. If an employee commits a criminal offence, s/he may also be prosecuted. In such cases, the department will always cooperate with the relevant authorities, and provide appropriate evidence.
