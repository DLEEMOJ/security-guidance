# Minimum User Clearance Requirements Guide

## Introduction

This Minimum User Clearance Requirements Guide outlines the level of security clearance required
for staff in order to access specific account types. This is a sub-page to the [Access Control Guide](access-control-guide.md).

## Minimum user clearance requirements

Most of the MoJ’s IT systems are able to process OFFICIAL information. Therefore all roles in the MoJ
require staff to attain Baseline personnel Security Standard (BPSS) clearance as a minimum to be
granted access rights to view OFFICIAL information. Some roles require staff to have higher
clearance such as Security Check (SC) or Developed Vetting (DV). See the Vetting Policy for further
details.

The table below provides a description for each type of MoJ staff user account and the
corresponding minimum clearance required. For the purposes of this guide, access rights have been
broken down into three user account types.

| User account type | Description | Minimum Clearance Required |
| --- | --- | --- |
| General User | Includes all users with entry-level access; includes read/write and read-only users. | BPSS |
| Application Administrator/Privileged User | Typically an application system manager, i.e. those with the rights to create/remove user accounts and provide internal support. | BPSS but may require SC |
| System Administrator | A system administrator does not necessarily have a ‘need-to-know’ about the business information held on the systems they support. However, they do have administrative privileges which allows them to view data held on those systems and change their configuration. | BPSS but may require SC |

The clearance level indicated in the table above is separate to the clearance level required for a particular job role and sets the minimum requirement for access to a MoJ IT system and account. All roles in the MoJ require staff to attain BPSS as a minimum. Some roles require staff to have higher clearance such as SC or DV.

If a system or application handles very sensitive information, this may require administrators to hold higher levels of clearance. The MoJ HQ and Executive Agencies have specific requirements for DV/DV STRAP clearance for individual systems and these should be followed if applicable. Please contact the Cyber Assistance Team and/or the Vetting Policy for further information.
