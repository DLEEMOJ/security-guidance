# Minimum User Clearance Requirements Guide

## Introduction

This Minimum User Clearance Requirements Guide outlines the level of security clearance required
for staff in order to access specific account types. This is a sub-page to the [Access Control Guide](access-control-guide.md).

## Minimum user clearance requirements

Most of the MoJ’s IT systems are able to process OFFICIAL information. Therefore all roles in the MoJ
require staff to attain Baseline Personnel Security Standard (BPSS) clearance as a minimum to be
granted access rights to view OFFICIAL information. Some roles require staff to have higher clearance.

Someone in an IT role who would need anything beyond BPSS:

- Has long term, regular, unsupervised access to data centres / comms rooms
- Has regular privileged unsupervised and unconstrained access to systems which contain data for multiple MoJ systems (e.g. backups, console access to multiple cloud services etc).
- Has cryptography responsibilities and handling, under advice from the Crypto Custodian
- Has access to multiple system security testing outcomes which reveal vulnerabilities in live services
- Roles, such as system support or IT investigation roles, which enables individual to act as another user, or have ability to obtain credentials for another user, or directly access other users' data without further authority or authorisation

If any of the above are true SC is required. If none of the above are true BPSS, DBS or Enhanced Check is sufficient.

The MoJ HQ and Executive Agencies have specific requirements for DV/DV STRAP clearance for individual systems and these should be followed if applicable.
