# Mobile Devices and Remote Working Policy

## Introduction

This policy gives an overview of mobile devices and teleworking/remote working security principles and responsibilities within the Ministry of Justice (MoJ) and provides a summary of the MoJ's related policies and guides in relation to mobile devices and remote working.

## Who is it for?

This policy is aimed at:
- **Technical users:** these are in-house MoJ Digital and Technology staff who are responsible for implementing controls throughout technical design, development, system integration and operation. This includes DevOps, Software Developers, Technical Architects and Service Owners. It also includes Incident Managers from the Event, Problem, Incident, CSI and Knowledge (EPICK) Team.
- **Service Providers:** defined as any other MoJ business group, agency, contractor, IT supplier and partner who in any way designs, develops or supplies services (including processing, transmitting and storing data) for, or on behalf of the MoJ.
- **General users:** all other staff working for the MoJ.

'All MoJ users' refers to General users, Technical users and Service Providers as defined above.

## Mobile devices

When using mobile devices, special care must be taken to ensure that business information is not compromised. When issuing MoJ mobile devices the following points must be adhered to:

- mobile devices must be registered as a MoJ asset
- software installation must not be available
- ability for remote disabling, erasure or lockout
- usage of approved web services and web apps

### Use in public places

Care must be taken when using mobile devices in public places, meeting rooms and other unprotected areas. Protection must be in place to avoid the unauthorised access to or disclosure of the information stored and processed by these devices.

[Cryptography](https://ministryofjustice.github.io/security-guidance/cryptography/#cryptography) guide offers techniques and information used at MoJ in support of stronger security when using mobile devices. Also, the [Access Control](https://ministryofjustice.github.io/security-guidance/access-control-guide/#access-control-guide) guide explains how the MoJ manages access to its IT systems so that users have access only to the material they need to see in a secure manner.

### Theft or loss

Mobile devices must be physically protected against theft especially when left, for example, in cars and other forms of transport, hotel rooms, conference centres and meeting places. MoJ must establish a specific procedure covering legal, insurance and security requirements in cases of loss or theft of mobile devices.

### Protecting sensitive content

Devices carrying important, sensitive or critical business information must not be left unattended and, where possible, should be physically locked away, or special locks should be used to secure the devices.

### Use of private equipment

MoJ does not allow or support the use of private devices for work purposes.

## Remote working

Remote working refers to all forms of work outside of the office, including non-traditional work environments such as:

- telecommuting
- flexible workplace
- virtual work environments

MoJ allows remote working, but the following points must be addressed in the approval process:

- the existing physical security of the remote working site, taking into account the physical security of the
building and the local environment
- the communications security requirements, taking into account the need for remote access to the
MoJ's internal systems, the sensitivity of the information that will be accessed and passed
over the communication link and the sensitivity of the internal system
- no use of privately owned equipment;
- the threat of unauthorised access to information or resources from other persons using the
accommodation, e.g. family and friends
- the use of home networks and requirements or restrictions on the configuration of wireless
network services
- malware protection and firewall requirements

The guidelines and arrangements to be considered should include:

- the provision of suitable equipment and storage furniture for the remote working activities, where the
use of privately owned equipment that is not under the control of the MoJ is not allowed
- a definition of the work permitted, the hours of work, the classification of information that may be
held and the internal systems and services that the remote worker is authorised to access
- the provision of suitable communication equipment, including methods for securing remote access
- physical security
- the provision of hardware and software support and maintenance
- the provision of insurance should be considered
- the procedures for backup and business continuity
- audit and security monitoring
- revocation of authority and access rights, and the return of equipment when the remote working
activities are terminated.

## Enforcement

This policy is enforced by lower level policies, standards, procedures and guidance.
Non-conformance with this policy could result in disciplinary action taken in accordance with the departmentâ€™s Disciplinary procedures. This could result in penalties up to and including dismissal. If an employee commits a criminal offence, s/he may also be prosecuted. In such cases, the department will always cooperate with the relevant authorities, and provide appropriate evidence.
