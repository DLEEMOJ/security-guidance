# Technical Security Controls Guide

## Introduction

This guide explains the technical security controls that should be implemented on information systems developed, procured or operated by the MoJ or on its behalf. This guide aligns with NIST 800-53 and NCSC technical control requirements and provides the MoJ with 3 phases/layers of defence. These controls must be implemented to ensure the MoJ's network infrastructure is secure. This page is a directory to the three layers of defence which form the Technical Security Controls Guide.

## Related guides

[Defensive Layer 1: Creating a baseline security environment - general and creating a baseline security - software development and system configuration](../technical-security-controls-guide-defensive-layer-1.md/)
Layer 1 sets out the technical controls required to build strong network foundations, including secure configuration and software development.

[Defensive Layer 2: Implementing monitoring capabilities](../technical-security-controls-guide-defensive-layer-2.md/)
Layer 2 builds a monitoring capability for the network and extends existing security controls to mobile devices.

[Defensive Layer 3: Implementing monitoring and maintenance tools](../technical-security-controls-guide-defensive-layer-3.md/)
Layer 3 technical controls must be implemented after the completion of Layer 1 and Layer 2. Layer 3 controls help to mature network security controls for a defence-in-depth security approach.

## Who is this guide for?

This guide has two audiences:

1. The in-house MoJ Digital and Technology staff who are responsible for implementing controls throughout technical design, development, system integration and operation. This includes DevOps, Software Developers, Technical Architects and Service Owners. It also includes Incident Managers from the Event, Problem, Incident, CSI and Knowledge (EPICK) Team.

2. Any other MoJ business group, agency, contractor, IT supplier and partner who in any way designs, develops or supplies services (including processing, transmitting and storing data) for, or on behalf of the MoJ.

Within this guide the MoJ's 'systems' applies to:

* hardware - laptops, PCs, servers, mobile devices and any other IT equipment
* software - such as operating system (OS) and applications
* services - such as remote databases or cloud-based tools like Slack.
