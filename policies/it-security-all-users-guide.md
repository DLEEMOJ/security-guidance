# IT Security Users Guide

## Introduction

This guide provides more information on the actions expected of all MoJ users when using MoJ equipment and infrastructure. This guide is a sub-page to the [IT Security Policy](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/security-guidance/blob/Local/policies/it-security-policy.md).

## Who is this for?

1. Technical users: these are in-house MoJ Digital and Technology staff who are responsible for implementing controls throughout technical design, development, system integration and operation. This includes DevOps, Software Developers, Technical Architects and Service Owners. It also includes Incident Managers from the Event, Problem, Incident, CSI and Knowledge (EPICK) Team.
2. Service Providers: defined as any other MoJ business group, agency, contractor, IT supplier and partner who in any way designs, develops or supplies services (including processing, transmitting and storing data) for, or on behalf of the MoJ.
3. General users: all other staff working for the MoJ.

'All MoJ users' refers to General users, Technical users and Service Providers as defined above.

## Approach

The MoJ is committed to protecting its staff, assets and data. These include personal data of those who interact with the Justice System, our staff and suppliers; other data we've been entrusted with, as well as ensuring the continued operation of our systems and processes. The MoJ will ensure information security controls are designed and implemented to protect MoJ data, IT Assets and reputation based around the following requirements:

- **Confidentiality**: knowing and ensuring information can only be accessed by those authorised to do so
- **Integrity**: knowing and ensuring the accuracy and completeness of data and that it has not been deliberately or inadvertently modified from a previous version
- **Availability**: knowing and ensuring that IT systems and data can always be accessed when required.

## Assets

This IT security policy applies to all premises, physical equipment, software and data owned or managed by the MoJ. This includes IT systems, whether developed by the MoJ or managed by IT service providers. It covers the use of IT equipment and the information processed on those IT systems, irrespective of location and provides direction and support to preserve the confidentiality, integrity and availability of MoJ resources.

## Information security classification

The MoJ maintains an Information Security Policy, which aligns with the HM Government Security Classifications, to provide a framework for safeguarding data from risks including, but not limited to, unauthorised destruction, modification, disclosure, access, use and removal.

All MoJ Staff are responsible for ensuring data is:
- classified correctly as detailed in the [Information Classification, Handling and Security Guide](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/security-guidance/blob/Local/policies/information-classification-handling-and-security-guide.md)
- distributed only in accordance with the statements of this policy and related guides
- protected by the appropriate security controls to ensure its confidentiality, integrity and availability.

Access to said classified information shall be controlled in accordance with the requirements set out within the MoJ [Access Control Guide](https://ministryofjustice.github.io/security-guidance/access-control-guide/#access-control-guide).

## Physical and personnel security

The Physical Security Policy defines how physical access to assets must be controlled within the MoJ to prevent unauthorised access, use, modification, loss or damage.  All MoJ users must understand that:

- All MoJ IT systems and services must be assessed against environmental risks (e.g. flood or fire) to maintain the asset's confidentiality, integrity and availability.
- The MoJ's IT Teams are not directly responsible for the physical security and environment of the MoJ sites.
- Physical security controls and the environment in which the MoJ IT systems operate form part of a system's overall risk landscape, and, therefore, all MoJ users must ensure they adhere to the security controls and requirements set out in this policy.
- Unless otherwise formally agreed by the MoJ, all MoJ users, including agency staff and contractors who have access to MOJ data, require [BPSS](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/government-baseline-personnel-security-standard).
- [National Security Vetting](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/security-vetting-and-clearance#applicant) should only be applied for where it is necessary, proportionate and adds real value.
- The MoJ does not have a standing requirement for system administrators or application developers to maintain Security Check (SC).

Further information is available from [MoJ Group Security](mailto:mojgroupsecurity@justice.gov.uk) and [CPNI Guidance](https://www.cpni.gov.uk/physical-security).

## Identity and access control

The MoJ [Access Control Guide](https://ministryofjustice.github.io/security-guidance/access-control-guide/#access-control-guide) ensures that information and IT assets can be accessed by only authorised personnel and that each individual is accountable for their actions.

The guide outlines the controls and processes designed to limit access based on a 'need to know' basis and according to defined roles and responsibilities.

The MoJ [Access Control Guide](https://ministryofjustice.github.io/security-guidance/access-control-guide/#access-control-guide) addresses access control principles such as identification, authentication, authorisation and accounting.  

## Password management

The MoJ [Password Management Guide](https://ministryofjustice.github.io/security-guidance/password-management-guide/#password-management-guide) sets out the requirements for strong password implementation and management to help prevent unauthorised access to MoJ systems.  Examples include password creation, authentication, storage and management.

## Email security

The MoJ [Email Security Guide](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/security-guidance/blob/Local/policies/email-security-guide.md) specifies the controls and processes required to protect the MoJ's email systems from unauthorised access or misuse, that may compromise the confidentiality, integrity and/or availability of the information stored and shared within them.

The guide outlines the various security levels required to transfer information from the MoJ's email servers to organisations outside the MoJ and other government departments. It covers topics such as the threats to email security (phishing) and secure email transfer.

## Remote working and portable devices

The MoJ has in place a [Remote Working Standard](https://ministryofjustice.github.io/security-guidance/remote-working/#remote-working) which sets out the requirements for safely accessing and using the MoJ's systems and applications when working remotely, for example, from home, another government office or whilst travelling.

Mobile computing is the use of portable equipment such as mobile phone, laptop or tablet and supports remote working. Mobile computing equipment provided by the MoJ must be used in line with the [Acceptable Use Policy](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/security-guidance/blob/Local/policies/acceptable-use-policy.md).

Any request to take MoJ IT equipment abroad must follow the guidance provided in the [Acceptable Use Policy](../acceptable-use-policy/) and the Travelling Abroad Policy.

## Malware protection

The MoJ [Malware Protection Guide](https://ministryofjustice.github.io/security-guidance/malware-protection-guide-introduction/#malware-protection-guide---overview) specifies the controls and processes required to protect all systems against malware. Malware may enter the MoJ by employee email through the internet, mobile computers and removable media devices.

The MoJ [Malware Protection Guide](https://ministryofjustice.github.io/security-guidance/malware-protection-guide-introduction/#malware-protection-guide---overview) addresses the following relevant domains:

- implementation controls to stop malware entering MoJ devices and systems
- preventing malicious code from executing on MoJ devices and systems
- mitigating the impact of malware when entering MoJ devices and systems.

## Roles and responsibilities

All MoJ users are responsible for ensuring the confidentiality, integrity and availability of data within the MoJ. This includes all MoJ data and assets, and these responsibilities extend to all subpages and guidance referenced in this policy.

All MoJ users are required to comply with the roles and responsibilities outlined in the MoJ [Information Assurance Framework Process](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ni5bn9vXUj4JFKcoiEO8x31TFCE3AVWN-HxZcVzfNnc/edit?ts=5f10064a).
