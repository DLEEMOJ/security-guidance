# Equipment Reassignment Guide

## Introduction

This guide sets out the requirements for reassigning equipment whether laptop, mobile phone or other MoJ issued equipment from one user to another.

## Who is this for?

This guide applies to all staff in the MOJ, its Agencies, Associated Offices and Arm’s Length Bodies (ALBs), including contractors, agency and casual staff and service providers, who use MoJ computing equipment provided by the Department for on-site, remote working or mobile computing.

This guidance relates to technological equipment that can record or hold data, such as laptops, mobile phones, printers/scanners and USB memory sticks.

## Returning Equipment

When a project completes, or a colleague leaves or moves to a new role, equipment no longer required must be returned.  The line manager (LM) needs to put in the Service Catalogue request to return the item.

 - If the leaver is in the office they should return the devices to the LM who then arranges for a collection
 - If leaver is based remotely, the LM arranges for a collection from the leaver’s location

In both scenarios, the LM needs to submit the request. This equipment might then become available for use by other employees. When returned, line managers should identify all such devices and ensure that they are recorded in an asset register.  In many cases, it might not be cost-effective to consider reusing or reassigning this equipment as:

 - older technology may have been heavily used
 - it is more likely to have operating problems and failures
 - it may not be supported, updated or patched
 - it will be slower than new equipment

As a result, depending on the expected use of the reassigned device, it may be preferable that a new machine is used rather than repurposing the reassigned device.

The equipment should be reviewed to ensure that sensitive data will not be lost by erasing the contents of the device.  Any sensitive data identified should be copied and relocated to a secure location before the device is made ready for reuse or destroyed.  

Any IT equipment which is no longer needed or has reached its “end of life” must have its data securely deleted and sensitive confirmed to be unreadable and unrecoverable before redistribution or reuse within the organisation, see below.

## Equipment Reassignment

The equipment cannot be passed from one user to the next without
being formally reassigned.

Equipment must be completely 'cleaned' to an 'as-new' state before it is reused or reassigned. This means that all storage media in the device must be fully erased.  Be aware that deleting visible files, emptying files from the “Recycle Bin” of a computer or reformatting a drive are not considered a sufficiently secure method of wiping equipment, as data recovery software could be used by a new owner to “undelete” files or “unformat” a drive.  

In order to really erase data it is necessary to use the appropriate data-shredding software for the media being erased. These programs don't just delete data - they overwrite it multiple times to erase all trace, making it almost impossible for anyone to retrieve it.

The reassignment must be recorded by the line manager in the appropriate asset register.

## Equipment that cannot be reused

In the event that IT assets are no longer needed by the MoJ and cannot be securely wiped, the equipment may need to be physically destroyed.  More information can be found at [https://intranet.justice.gov.uk/guidance/security/it-computer-security/secure-disposal-of-ict-equipment/](https://intranet.justice.gov.uk/guidance/security/it-computer-security/secure-disposal-of-ict-equipment/)

Redundant IT equipment should not be donated to charities, schools, etc.

## Leased equipment

Managers should ensure that any equipment that is leased has a data destruction clause written into the contract. Under such an arrangement, the supplier will ensure that data is wiped when it is returned.
