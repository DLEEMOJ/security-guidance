# Equipment Reassignment Guide

## Introduction

This guide sets out the requirements for reassigning equipment whether laptop, mobile phone or other MoJ issued equipment from one user to another.  

## Who is this for?

This policy is aimed at:

1. **Technical users**: these are in-house MoJ Digital and Technology staff who are responsible for implementing controls throughout technical design, development, system integration and operation. This includes DevOps, Software Developers, Technical Architects and Service Owners. It also includes Incident Managers from the Event, Problem, Incident, CSI and Knowledge (EPICK) Team.
2. **Service Providers**: defined as any other MoJ business group, agency, contractor, IT supplier and partner who in any way designs, develops or supplies services (including processing, transmitting and storing data) for, or on behalf of the MoJ.
3. **General users**: all other staff working for the MoJ.

'All MoJ users' refers to General users, Technical users and Service Providers as defined above.

## Returning Equipment

When a project completes, or a colleague leaves or moves to a new role, equipment no longer required must be returned.  The line manager (LM) needs to put in the Service Catalogue request to return the item.  This equipment might then become available for use by other employees. In many cases, it might not be cost-effective to consider reusing or reassigning this equipment as:

 - older technology may have been heavily used
 - it is more likely to have operating problems and failures
 - it may not be supported, updated or patched
 - it will be slower than new equipment

As a result, depending on the expected use of the reassigned device, it may be preferable that a new machine is used rather than repurposing the reassigned device.

The LM is responsible for ensuring that the equipment is reviewed to ensure that sensitive data will not be lost by erasing the contents of the device.  Any sensitive data identified should be copied and relocated to a secure location, such as MoJ Teams or directly to Sharepoint, before the device is made ready for reuse or destroyed.  

Any IT equipment which is no longer needed or has reached its “end of life” must have its data securely deleted and confirmed to be unreadable and unrecoverable before destruction, redistribution or reuse within the organisation, see below.

## Equipment Reassignment

The equipment cannot be passed from one user to the next without being formally reassigned.

Equipment must be completely 'cleaned' to an 'as-new' state before it is reused or reassigned. This means that all storage media in the device must be fully erased.  Be aware that deleting visible files, emptying files from the “Recycle Bin” of a computer or reformatting a drive are not considered a sufficiently secure method of wiping equipment, as data recovery software could be used by a new owner to “undelete” files or “unformat” a drive.  

In order to really erase data it is necessary to use the appropriate data-shredding software for the media being erased. These programs don't just delete data - they overwrite it multiple times to erase all trace, making it almost impossible for anyone to retrieve it.  Another option is to re-encrypt the drive using a different password and then delete the data to free up space.

The reassignment must be recorded by the LM in the appropriate asset register.

## Equipment that cannot be reused

In the event that IT assets are no longer needed by the MoJ and cannot be securely wiped, the equipment may need to be physically destroyed.  More information can be found at [Secure disposal of IT equipment](https://intranet.justice.gov.uk/guidance/security/it-computer-security/secure-disposal-of-it-equipment/)

Redundant IT equipment should not be donated to charities, schools, etc.

## Leased equipment

Managers should ensure that any equipment that is leased has a data destruction clause written into the contract. Under such an arrangement, the supplier will ensure that data is wiped when it is returned.  For an example of a data destruction clause, see section 11 of the [Modern Security Clause for formal MoJ promises (Contracts)](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1EOTFobaoN_GaXrRBdF-HbN5DVSvRh29APPbzAadssoQ/edit#heading=h.e9v4unsig6qa) FIXME - Tom this may not be visible to the whole of MoJ.
