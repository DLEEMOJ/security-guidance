# Information Security Policies

## Introduction

This policy gives an overview of information security principles and responsibilities within the Ministry of Justice (MoJ) and provides a summary of the MoJ's related policies and guides in relation to information security.

## Who is it for?

This policy is aimed at:
- **Technical users:** these are in-house MoJ Digital and Technology staff who are responsible for implementing controls throughout technical design, development, system integration and operation. This includes DevOps, Software Developers, Technical Architects and Service Owners. It also includes Incident Managers from the Event, Problem, Incident, CSI and Knowledge (EPICK) Team.
- **Service Providers:** defined as any other MoJ business group, agency, contractor, IT supplier and partner who in any way designs, develops or supplies services (including processing, transmitting and storing data) for, or on behalf of the MoJ.
- **General users:** all other staff working for the MoJ.

'All MoJ users' refers to General users, Technical users and Service Providers as defined above.

## Policies for information security

A set of policies for information security must be defined, approved, published and communicated to employees and relevant external parties. At the highest level, the MoJ must define an “information security policy” which is approved by by the Chief Information Security Officer (CISO) and which sets out the the MoJ's approach to managing its information security objectives.

### Current information security policies

The following policies have been approved for MoJ use:

[T Security Policy (Overview)](https://ministryofjustice.github.io/security-guidance/it-security-policy-overview/#it-security-policy-overview)
[IT Security All Users Policy](https://ministryofjustice.github.io/security-guidance/it-security-all-users-policy/#it-security-all-users-policy)
[IT Security Technical Users Policy](https://ministryofjustice.github.io/security-guidance/it-security-technical-users-policy/#it-security-technical-users-policy)

### Review of the policies for information security

The policies for information security must be reviewed at planned intervals, or if significant changes occur to ensure their continuing suitability, adequacy and effectiveness.

## Enforcement

This policy is enforced by lower level policies, standards, procedures and guidance. Non-conformance with this policy could result in disciplinary action taken in accordance with the department’s Disciplinary procedures. This could result in penalties up to and including dismissal. If an employee commits a criminal offence, s/he may also be prosecuted. In such cases, the department will always cooperate with the relevant authorities, and provide appropriate evidence.
