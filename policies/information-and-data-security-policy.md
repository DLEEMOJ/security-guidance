# Information and Data Security Policy

## Introduction

This Policy sets out the MoJ's information security requirements for preserving the security of information throughout the end-to-end information lifecycle in alignment with security classification.

## Who is this for?

This guide is aimed at two audiences:

1. The in-house MoJ Digital and Technology staff who are responsible for implementing controls throughout technical design, development, system integration and operation. This includes DevOps, Software Developers, Technical Architects and Service Owners. It also includes Incident Managers from the Event, Problem, Incident, CSI and Knowledge (EPICK) Team.

2. Any other MoJ business group, agency, contractor, IT supplier and partner who in any way designs, develops or supplies services (including processing, transmitting and storing data) for, or on behalf of the MoJ.

## Information security policy statements

This policy establishes responsibilities and minimum information security measures necessary to maintain a proportionally secure environment. This policy is supported by the Information Classification, Handling and Security Guide and other related MoJ policies.

This policy will support the MoJ to:

 - achieve and maintain alignment with the information security principles of confidentiality, integrity, and availability   

 - comply with the UK Data Protection Act (2018) when processing personal information

 - assign defined accountability for information security

 - obtain assurance that information security activities are operating as intended.

## Roles and responsibilities

The Senior Information Risk Owner (SIRO) is ultimately accountable and responsible for information risk in the MoJ.

To fulfil their responsibilities, all MoJ Digital and Technology users must:

 - implement technical controls to protect the MoJ's information assets. Refer to the Technical Controls Guide for more information

 - undertake all mandatory information security training and participate in other information security training and awareness programmes as required

 - understand when and how to request ad-hoc specialist security advice from the Cyber Assistance Team in the design, development, delivery and review of digital and technology products or services in the MoJ.

## Information security principles

The security of information must be undertaken to meet the objectives of the three core information security principles:

| Principle | Description | Example |
|--- |---|---|
| **Confidentiality** | Ensuring information can only be accessed by those authorised to do so. | Only specific HR users can access the Payroll system. |
| **Integrity** | Ensuring the accuracy and completeness of data and that it has not been deliberately or inadvertently modified from a previous version. | A system's audit logs being monitored for unexpected and unauthorised modification. |
| **Availability** | Ensuring that IT systems and data can always be accessed when required. | IT systems are regularly maintained to prevent unplanned disruption. |

## Information security in the information lifecycle

The following information security principles need to be considered during each information lifecycle stage:

| Lifecycle stage | Example |
|--- |---|
| Collecting and creating | Ensuring information can only be accessed by those authorised to do so. |
| Using | Analysing user feedback to identify issues with the system... **through software that meets the information security requirements of the MoJ**. |
| Sharing | Sending the user feedback analysis to a contractor to help fix issues... **through secure email**. |
| Storing | Keeping the user feedback analysis... **on a secured cloud storage service or JustStore on Dom1**. |
| Archiving | Moving the user feedback analysis to an archive... **such as the Dom1 JustStore** or [LAA Crime Archive](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/laa-crime-apps-archive). |
| Destroying | Deleting the user feedback analysis permanently... **through the MoJ's approved** [file deletion tools](https://ministryofjustice.github.io/security-guidance/#data-destruction). |

Further examples can be found in the Information Classification, Handling and Security Guide.

## Information security based on information classification

All MoJ information must be protected over the course of its lifecycle and in line with its classification. More sensitive information must be protected with stricter security measures.

Detailed guidance on determining the information security classification and associated minimum measures for the MoJ's information is set out in the **Information Classification, Handling and Security Guide**.

Detailed guidance on these measures across security domains is found in the following policies and guides:

 - MoJ IT Security Policy
 - MoJ Corporate Security Policy
 - MoJ Secure Development Lifecycle Policy
 - MoJ IT Incident Management Policy
 - MoJ Access Control Guide
 - MoJ Email Security Guide
 - MoJ Malware Protection Guide
 - MoJ Password Management Guide
 - MoJ Technical Security Controls Guide
