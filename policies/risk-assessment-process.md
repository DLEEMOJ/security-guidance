# Risk Assessment Process

Input: Basic criteria, the scope and boundaries, and the organisation for the information security risk management process being established.
Action: Risks should be identified, quantified or qualitatively described, and prioritised against risk evaluation criteria and objectives relevant to the MoJ.

## Risk identification

Determine what could happen to cause a potential loss, and to gain insight into how, where and why the loss might happen.

## MOJ Risk Breakdown based on IAS1:


## Risk analysis

Undertaken in varying degrees of detail depending on the criticality of assets, extent of vulnerabilities known, and prior incidents involving in the MoJ.

## Risk evaluation

Risk evaluation criteria should be developed for evaluating the MoJ’s information security risk considering the followings:

- The strategic value of the business information process
- The criticality of the information assets involved
- Legal and regulatory requirements, and contractual obligations
- Operational and business importance of availability, confidentiality and integrity
- Stakeholders expectations and perceptions, and negative consequences for goodwill and reputation

Additionally, risk evaluation criteria can be used to specify priorities for risk treatment.

## Developing Risk Treatment Plan

Input: A list of risks prioritised according to risk evaluation criteria in relation to the incident scenarios that lead to those risks.
Action: Controls to reduce, retain, avoid, or share the risks should be selected and a risk treatment plan defined.

## Risk Acceptance

Input: Risk treatment plan and residual risk assessment subject to the acceptance decision of the MoJ’s managers.
Action: The decision to accept the risks and responsibilities for the decision should be made and formally recorded.

## Implementation of Risk Treatment Plan

Input: A list of risks prioritised according to risk evaluation criteria in relation to the incident scenarios that lead to those risks.
Action: Controls to reduce, retain, avoid, or share the risks should be selected and a risk treatment plan defined.

## Continual Monitoring and Reviewing of Risks

Input: All risk information obtained from the risk management activities.
Action: Risks and their factors (i.e. value of assets, impacts, threats, vulnerabilities, likelihood of occurrence) should be monitored and reviewed to identify any changes in the context of the MoJ at an early stage, and to maintain an overview of the complete risk picture.
