# Cryptography Policy

## Introduction

This policy gives an overview of information security principles and responsibilities within the Ministry of Justice (MoJ) and provides a summary of the MoJ's related policies and guides in relation to information security.

## Who is it for?

This policy is aimed at:
- **Technical users:** these are in-house MoJ Digital and Technology staff who are responsible for implementing controls throughout technical design, development, system integration and operation. This includes DevOps, Software Developers, Technical Architects and Service Owners. It also includes Incident Managers from the Event, Problem, Incident, CSI and Knowledge (EPICK) Team.
- **Service Providers:** defined as any other MoJ business group, agency, contractor, IT supplier and partner who in any way designs, develops or supplies services (including processing, transmitting and storing data) for, or on behalf of the MoJ.
- **General users:** all other staff working for the MoJ.

'All MoJ users' refers to General users, Technical users and Service Providers as defined above.

## Cryptographic controls

MoJ must introduce cryptographic controls to ensure proper and effective protection of the confidentiality, authenticity and/or integrity of its information.

### Use of cryptographic controls

Making a decision as to whether a cryptographic solution is appropriate should be seen as part of the wider process of risk assessment and selection of controls. This assessment can then be used to determine whether a cryptographic control is appropriate, what type of control should be applied and for what purpose and business processes.

### Key management

Cryptographic algorithms, key lengths and usage practices must be selected according to best practice. Appropriate key management requires secure processes for generating, storing, archiving, retrieving, distributing, retiring and destroying cryptographic keys.

All cryptographic keys must be protected against modification and loss. In addition, secret and private keys need protection against unauthorised use as well as disclosure. Equipment used to generate, store and archive keys must be physically protected.

In addition to securely managing secret and private keys, the authenticity of public keys must also be considered. This authentication process can be done using public key certificates, which are normally issued by a certification authority, which must be a recognised organisation with suitable controls and procedures in place to provide the required degree of trust.

The contents of service level agreements or contracts with external suppliers of cryptographic services, for example, with a certification authority, should cover issues of liability, reliability of services and response times for the provision of services.

## Enforcement

This policy is enforced by lower level policies, standards, procedures and guidance. Non-conformance with this policy could result in disciplinary action taken in accordance with the departmentâ€™s Disciplinary procedures. This could result in penalties up to and including dismissal. If an employee commits a criminal offence, s/he may also be prosecuted. In such cases, the department will always cooperate with the relevant authorities, and provide appropriate evidence.
