# Cyber and Technical Security Guidance

## Summary

This site documents some of the security decisions that the
[Ministry of Justice (MoJ)](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/ministry-of-justice)
has made for the products we operate, and our relationships with suppliers.

The MoJ [Technical Guidance](https://ministryofjustice.github.io/technical-guidance/) covers technical decisions in the MoJ more widely.

### Background

*Government Functional Standard - GovS 007: Security* replaces the HMG Security Policy Framework (SPF) last published in May 2018. It also incorporates the *Minimum Cyber Security Standard (MCSS)* which defines the minimum security measures that departments implement with regards to protecting their information, technology and digital services to meet their SPF and National Cyber Security Strategy obligations.

Sections 6.12 Cyber security and 6.13 Technical security of the standard state:

> - The security of information and data is essential to good government and public confidence. To operate effectively, HMG needs to maintain the confidentiality, integrity and availability of its information, systems and infrastructure, and the services it provides. Any organisation that handles government information shall meet the standards expected of HM Government.
> - Technical security relates to the protection of security systems from compromise and/or external interference that may have occurred as a result of an attack.

## Taxonomy

MoJ has developed their cyber and technical security taxonomy as follows:

| Level 1 | Level 2 |
| --- | --- |
| Cyber | Access Control |
| | Asset Management |
| | Cryptography |
| | Operational Security |
| Technical | Principles |
| | Data and Information |
| | Incident Management |
| | Software Development |

Documents have been developed and defined within this taxonomy, and are listed in the next section together with their suggested target audiences.

### Intranet

There are other cyber and technical security guidance documents available to reference. A large number of these documents are available in the [IT and Computer Security](https://intranet.justice.gov.uk/guidance/security/it-computer-security/) repository on the MoJ Intranet, but these documents are currently being reviewed and progressively are being incorporated into this main [Security Guidance](.) repository.

### Technical Guidance

The MoJ [Technical Guidance](https://ministryofjustice.github.io/technical-guidance/) should be read together with this security-focused guidance.
