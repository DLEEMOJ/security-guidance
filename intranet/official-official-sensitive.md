##`OFFICIAL-SENSITIVE`

`OFFICIAL-SENSITIVE` is **not** a classification. `SENSITIVE` is a handling caveat for a small subset of information marked `OFFICIAL` that require *special* handling by staff above and beyond the described `OFFICIAL` baseline.

The `SENSITIVE` handling caveat is a *reminder* as opposed to a requirement for additional controls nor a description of a minimum set of controls.

###DESCRIPTORS

Descriptors *can* be applied (but they do not need to be) to help identify certain categories of `SENSITIVE` information.

Descriptors should be applied in the format `OFFICIAL-SENSITIVE [DESCRIPTOR]`

The Cabinet Office maintains the following list of core descriptors to ensure a consistent approach is adopted across all departments:

* `COMMERCIAL`: Commercial- or market-sensitive information, including that subject to statutory or regulatory obligations, that may be damaging to HMG or to a commercial partner if improperly accessed.

* `LOCSEN`: Sensitive information that locally engaged staff overseas cannot access.

* `PERSONAL`: Particularly sensitive information relating to an identifiable individual, where inappropriate access could have damaging consequences. For example, where relating to investigations, vulnerable individuals, or the personal / medical records of people in sensitive posts (e.g. military, SIA).


Descriptors are **not** codewords.
