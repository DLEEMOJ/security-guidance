#Accessing Ministry of Justice (MoJ) IT systems overseas

This guidance information applies to all staff, contractors and agency staff who work for the MoJ.

**Note:** If you are national security cleared to SC or DV levels, or subject to STRAP briefing, follow this process for all your trips, regardless of whether they are for business or personal reasons.

As a government official travelling overseas, you should consider that you may be of interest to hostile parties regardless of your role. By following MoJ policies and processes, you can help reduce the risk to yourself and limit the damage of exposure of sensitive information.

Essential guidance is provided in the [overseas travel information](overseas-travel.md).

In general, it is acceptable for MoJ users to access MoJ services from overseas, and to do this using their MoJ equipment. But before you travel, consider:

* Do you need to take MoJ IT equipment overseas or access MoJ IT systems to do your job?
* Can the business need be met in another way or by someone else?
* If you just need to manage your inbox while away, can you delegate permissions to your inbox to a colleague to manage on your behalf?
* Have you left enough time to check and obtain necessary approvals? The process can take several weeks, depending on the circumstances. This is because it may be necessary to apply additional technical controls to protect you, your devices, and any data the devices can access.

##Steps to follow before travelling

##Part One

1.  Get confirmation from your Senior Line Manager (Head of your immediate team) that there is a business need for you to take MoJ IT equipment overseas and access MoJ services. Keep a note of the answers you get.
2.  Proceed directly to [Part Two](#part-two) of this process below if you are travelling to or passing through one of the following countries **and** are intending to take any MoJ IT equipment or device:

    > Argentina, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, China (including Hong Kong), Egypt, Estonia, Georgia, India, Indonesia, Iran, Israel, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Latvia, Lithuania, Moldova, the northern area of the Republic of Cyprus, North Korea, Pakistan, Russia, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, South Korea, Syria, Turkey, Turkmenistan, UAE, Ukraine, Uzbekistan.

3.  Proceed directly to [Part Two](#part-two) of this process below if you are national security cleared to SC or DV levels, **and** are planning to travel to or pass through one of the listed countries above, even if you are not taking MoJ IT equipment or planning to access MoJ systems or services.
4.  If you are subject to STRAP briefing and intend to travel to or through countries not in Western Europe, North America, Australia, or New Zealand, notify the STRAP team at [STRAPTeam@cluster2security.gov.uk](mailto:STRAPTeam@cluster2security.gov.uk) **and** proceed directly to [Part Two](#part-two) of this process below
5.  If you have reached this step, you do not need to seek further formal approval for your trip.
6.  Take a **non-physical copy** of this guidance; it includes useful contact details that help in the event of a problem while travelling.
7.  Check if you need to do anything to prepare for [International Roaming](#international-roaming). See the [International Roaming](#international-roaming) section below.

##Part Two

1.  Collect the following information:
    * Name.
    * Email address.
    * Your business area.
    * Your Security Clearance.
    * The network you use to access MoJ data, services, or applications, for example DOM1 or Quantum/MoJO, or online services such as AWS or Google Workspace.
    * The make/type of equipment you want to take with you.
    * Asset Tag details.
    * Countries you'll be visiting or passing through.
    * Dates of travel.
    * Transport details where possible, for example flights or rail journeys.
    * Proposed methods of connecting to MoJ systems or services, for example MoJ VPN, Global Protect VPN (for Macs), wifi, or Mobile Data (3G/4G/5G).
    * Reason for maintaining access while overseas.
    * The MoJ data, applications, or services you expect to access during your trip.
    * Who you are travelling with.
2.  The next step depends on your MoJ business area:
    * If you are part of MoJ HQ, HMPPS HQ, HMCTS, or NPS, contact your Senior Line Manager and ask for approval to take MoJ equipment overseas and access MoJ services. Ask for any special details or considerations that apply to your proposed travel arrangements. Keep a note of the answers you get.
    * If you are part of HMPPS (but *not* HQ), contact your Governor and ask for approval to take MoJ equipment overseas and access MoJ services. Ask for any special details or considerations that apply to your proposed travel arrangements. Keep a note of the answers you get.
3.  Fill in the [overseas travel form](/gs/overseas-travel-form.docx).
4.  Send the completed form to [security@justice.gov.uk](mailto:security@justice.gov.uk), including the answers obtained from the earlier parts of this process.
5.  Your request will be considered, and an answer provided, as quickly as possible.
6.  Check if you need to do anything to prepare for [International Roaming](#international-roaming). See the [International Roaming](#international-roaming) section below.
7.  Take a **non-physical copy** of this guidance; it includes useful contact details that help in the event of a problem while travelling.

##International Roaming

While travelling, you might incur roaming charges when using your MoJ equipment for calls or accessing services. These charges must be paid by your Business Unit. This is another reason for having a good business need to take MoJ equipment overseas.

By default, MoJ equipment is not enabled for use overseas. Before travelling, request the ServiceNow Catalogue item for International Roaming, and the remote wipe function. This helps protect the MoJ equipment in case of loss or theft.

**Note:** International Roaming can be found on [Service Now](https://mojprod.service-now.com/moj_sp/?id=home) using: **Home** > **Order IT** > **Telephony** > **Mobile Devices** > **Request for International Roaming**.

##If you have any problem when using MoJ equipment overseas

Contact the [IT Service Desk](#contacts) immediately. Tell them if the MoJ equipment is lost, stolen, or was potentially compromised. This includes any time the equipment is deliberately removed out of your sight, such as by a customs official.

If any security-related incident occurs overseas, regardless of whether it involves MoJ equipment, you should contact the [Operational Security Team](mailto:OperationalSecurityTeam@justice.gov.uk) as soon as possible. See the [Contacts](#contacts) section below, and the guidance on [Reporting a Security Incident](/guidance/security/report-a-security-incident/) on the MoJ Intranet. This includes information on reporting an incident outside of UK working hours. For convenience, the out-of-hours telephone number for reporting incidents is repeated [below](#information-incident-reporting-line).

If there is a problem with your MoJ equipment, it might be necessary to disable your ability to connect to the MoJ network or services from your device. The IT Service Desk will do this if required. MoJ-issued phones might still have some functionality, to let you make phone calls, but the device should be treated as compromised and not used any more for any MoJ business.

**Note:** Do not be tempted to use non-MoJ equipment for MoJ business purposes. If you are having problems with MoJ equipment, you might wonder about using non-MoJ devices to progress a particularly important task, or to respond to an urgent email. This is not [acceptable](acceptable-use.md).
