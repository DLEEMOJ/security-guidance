#Secure disposal of IT equipment

The Ministry of Justice (MoJ) and its Executive Agencies and Arms Length Bodies use a wide variety of equipment, both physical and virtual. These resources are procured and managed though MoJ suppliers, who are normally responsible for the secure disposal of the resources when no longer used.

However, there are also other physical and virtual resources across the MoJ estate which might have been procured and managed locally. It is crucial that they are disposed of in a secure manner, to prevent data being leaked.

**Note:** When disposing of `SECRET` or `TOP SECRET` equipment, materials, or resources, you **SHALL** contact security: [security@justice.gov.uk](mailto:security@justice.gov.uk)
