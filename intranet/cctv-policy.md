#CCTV policy

The policy compliments the Ministry of Justice (MoJ)'s overall security policy.

The CCTV Policy applies to all employees, contractors, partners and service providers, including those on co-located sites and sites owned by other public bodies. This also includes employees of other organisations who are based in, or work at, MoJ occupied premises.

Agencies and arm's length bodies (ALBs) are expected to comply with the corporate framework, but **MAY** establish their own arrangements tailored to operational needs and **SHOULD** supplement the framework with local policy or guidance for any business-specific risk.

The MoJ has in place several CCTV surveillance systems installed within its core buildings. The policy details the purpose, usage and management of the CCTV systems, and the procedures to be followed to ensure the MoJ complies with relevant legislation and the current Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) Code of Practice.

The MoJ has due regard to the Data Protection Act 2018, the UK General Data Protection Regulation (UK GDPR), the Freedom of Information Act 2000, the Protection of Freedoms Act 2012 and the Human Rights Act 1998. The MoJ also has due regard to the Surveillance Camera Code of Practice, issued under the Protection of Freedoms Act 2012, and the 12 guiding principles contained therein.

The policy is based upon guidance issued by the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO).

The policy and the procedures detailed apply to the MoJ CCTV systems, including security guards' body worn cameras. CCTV images are monitored and recorded in strict accordance with this policy.

The policy is applicable to all buildings owned or occupied by the MoJ where MoJ monitored CCTV is installed.

The policy is available for download [here](/gs/MoJ_CCTV_Policy.docx).
