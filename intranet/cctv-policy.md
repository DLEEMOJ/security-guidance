This CCTV Policy applies to all employees, contractors, partners and service providers, including those on co-located sites and sites owned by other public bodies. This will also include employees of other organisations who are based in, or work at, the MoJ occupied premises.

The MoJ also has due regard to the Surveillance Camera Code of Practice, issued under the Protection of Freedoms Act 2012 and the 12 guiding principles contained therein.

This policy is based upon guidance issued by the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO).

This policy and the procedures detailed, applies to the MoJ CCTV systems including security guards' body worn cameras. CCTV images are monitored and recorded in strict accordance with this policy.
